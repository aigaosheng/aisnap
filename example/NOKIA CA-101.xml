<review><summary> Happy ordering experience </summary><name> Dave Martin </name><date> 2010-06-06 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> Genuine Nokia cable as advertised, at a great price an super fast delivery.I'm totally happy with this purchasing experience.  I bought it to use with a Nokia Neuron since the CA101-D that came with that phone is only 8" long and too short for where I wanted to use it, so this cable is perfect for the location I want to use it in. </content></review>

<review><summary> works great, can't beat the price </summary><name> Leslie Lemke </name><date> 2009-09-08 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> this cord worked great - a little slow on the shipping, but I did not pay the extra for fast delivery.  Great price, perfect product. </content></review>
<review><summary> Nokia CA-101 </summary><name> CCurtin </name><date> 2009-08-14 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> I love my Nokia E71 but Nokia opted not to package a connector cable in the unlocked version of the product. I don't have a data plan at the moment so I needed the CA-101 to be able to sync my calendar and notes entries. The device is meant for this to be done through data transfers via network service (hence no cable in box). I almost bought this cable on the [...]site for [...] and then thought to search Amazon where I found a new cable for[...] plus shipping. What a deal!!!! The purchase was smooth and the cable arrived a few days later. I'd use the seller again. </content></review>
