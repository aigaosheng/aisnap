<review><summary> This is the worst laptop I have ever owned. </summary><name> Jamie </name><date> 2010-07-25 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> I put up with my first Dell Latitude D600 for about a year before finally just throwing it away.  After maybe 3 months of owning it, at least 6 of the keys fell off, the battery stopped working, and I was not able to pick up wireless connections.  It died three times during the time period that I owned it, and after replacing the hard drive twice and the fan once, I realized that it just wasn't worth trying to "fix" anymore.Unfortunately, I received the exact same model of laptop as a gift after my previous one died.  This confirmed my belief that this model is an absolute piece of crap.  I have owned it less than a year, and the battery does not work, the power cord falls out all the time, a key has fallen off, and I have already had it sent off twice for repairs on the hard drive.  Recently, it physically fell into two pieces; the screen just detached from the keyboard and now it's utterly useless and will not turn on.I handled these laptops responsibly.  They always sat either on my desk or on my lap and I never took them out of my home.  I used them mostly for surfing the net and photo-editing, rarely downloaded anything, and did not clog it up with loads of pictures and music (it could only handle about 10 folders of music before being completely full anyway).  If you want a laptop that falls apart and constantly breaks from normal use, then this is the one for you. </content></review>
<review><summary> not what I expected </summary><name> sheryl </name><date> 2010-07-10 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> 7 day guarantee , 8th day didn't work.  Very unhappy  would not recommend. </content></review>
<review><summary> LOTS OF PROBLEMS>>>LOTS </summary><name> G. harry </name><date> 2010-06-16 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> First off, very poor packing in that it was in a flimsy box...with...crumpled up brown paper.Second, seller restores all his second hand computers with Windows xp service pack 3. Well that is great, seriously great. The down side is...he ships it with a windows xp service pack 2 recovery disk! Leads to a lot of potential problems. Basically as soon as you get the computer, restore it with your XP SP2 cd. The thing is!!!! First download all your drivers online to a thumb drive or cd if possible, or else...your done for. Don;t know what I am talking about? Then never buy one of these!Used computers in general are not for the computer beginner to intermediate, a serious background in knowledge is needed for some of the subtler things that come up unexpected. I'm talking about more than just inserting a disk. Especially if you are going to add office, or other software, or even have to type in a foreign language. Take my advice, don;t buy from him UNLESS YOU ARE VERY very very good with computers and troubleshooting them. Serious, this is not an angry review to "ruin" him, it's the facts and good advice, I hope you will take and avoid lost time and money, most importantly stress.Now thirdly...cd drive worked the first evening I got the computer. Next day, running my software fine and...*chirp* *slow scan* *chirp* *dead silence....ok the drive went dead!!! So...I go and buy an external dvd/cd drive, another $60. What was a seemingly fair deal turned out to just be, "you get what you pay for". A little suspect that the drive works for a few hours and then dies. Not making accusations that he is a crook, however he does have to make a profit somewhere. Sold me junk, I could have got off a popular auction site for about $30, I thought Amazon would have some integrity as it is sold through them...guess I was wrong. Buyer beware.Overall would rather buy from someone else, however, with some tweaking and a lot of know how, this being the second day, I think I have things worked out. All this seller does is buy used laptops off the internet, set them up with an SP3 back-up disk he has and ship them out to you...for better or for worse.... </content></review>
<review><summary> The Worst Deal yet </summary><name> Honestly Sincere </name><date> 2010-05-24 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> This was the worst computer I have ever boughten! I couldn't configurate it on the day I bought it. It was SO FRAGILE. The DVD drive was broken and looked like it had been glued together. If you tilted it the drive would fall out! The screen cracked the next day when I sat it "gently" on the table. Im so displeased with this computer. I'm not even going to return it, for fear that someone will glue it together and sell it to another innocent consumer. Very poor quality. I might report this site to YahooNews so that the world can know that it is a SCAM. You can keep your measly $200, Amazon. </content></review>
<review><summary> Great Product for the Price </summary><name> M. Dowdle </name><date> 2010-05-24 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> This was a great laptop for the price. Super fast shipping!  It was shipped the same day I bought it!  I was a bit disappointed because there was not a restore CD like was listed in the title but other than that I would recommend this seller! </content></review>
<review><summary> Not for me </summary><name> Jesse Golden </name><date> 2010-03-19 </date><rating> 3 </rating><content> Dont get me wrong, this is a great computer and works fine. It just isnt the right computer for me. This computer is just for casual web surfing and file transfer type things, not games or (big) downloads or anything like that. If thats all you do, the I recommend this computer for you. If you have any type of problem, customer service WILL help you, they are great and helped me the same day, within one hour. </content></review>

<review><summary> great for school </summary><name> Alexandria L. Griffith </name><date> 2010-02-18 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> I adore mine.I'm not a gamer or anything of the sort, I just use mine for internet purposes and college, and it's perfect. It lags a bit, which is annoying, but should be expected with the low price. Overall, I like it a lot. </content></review>

<review><summary> Not bad for a budget laptop </summary><name> Paul Berry </name><date> 2010-01-10 </date><rating> 3 </rating><content> I ordered a refurbished D600 from Dell Financial Services 3 years ago.  It was a good solid laptop while I had it.  Mine had 1gb of RAM and  a CD/DVDROM (no burner).  Mine also did not come with an XP CD or any recovery disc at all.  I had an old Windows 2000 CD, so I loaded that.  I tried upgrading it to Vista Home Basic.  It was way slow, even with 1gb of RAM.  I ran Server 2003 and Server 2008 on it for a while, to study for certification exams.  I also ran Fedora and Ubuntu Linux for a while.  It even ran a hackintosh version of OS X fairly well.  I think the hard drive started going bad after I reformatted it so many times.  I replaced the hard drive with a spare 20gb drive.  This drive was tpo small for Vista, Office and all the latest patches.  I went back to Windows 2000, because it was small and ran the best.  I never tried it with XP, because Dell did not include the XP CD with my purchase.  This was a great laptop for learning different operating systems in a test environment.I did have a few problems with this laptop.  First, the CD/DVD drive had problems booting from CDs after a while.  DVDs seemed to boot ok.  Second, the hard drive starget going bad.  I think I just wore it out.  It was easy enough to replace myself.  Third, way slow with Windows Vista.  I agree with the other reviewers who said it's too slow to be a gaming computer.My biggest complaint with the D600, is that it's so darn heavy.  It weighs almost 5 1/2 lbs, or over 6 lbs if you include the charger.  That's just too heavy to lug around when I'm traveling.  I sold it to a friend for a very good price and ordered a Dell Mini 9 netbook to take traveling.  The 2.2 lb Netbook is way more convenient to take traveling.  By the way, most Netbooks have a 1.6ghz processor compared to the 1.4ghz processor in the D600.  Sometimes I miss the 14 inch screen, but the Netbooks small size, lightweight and portablity more than make up for it. </content></review>
<review><summary> Buyers Please Beware of what you are purchasing </summary><name> T. Clarke </name><date> 2009-12-07 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> Buyers, please pay particular attention to the 5 star review of this computer.  I know the price looks good but if it is not able to perform to your expectations, you're wasting your money.  First the hard drive is very small in comparison to todays standards.  Programs get larger with each new version requiring more space on your hard drive.  Downloading pictures and music will quickly eat up the 40 gig hard drive.  If you are just looking for a computer to type documents, log on to the internet to do minimal surfing read email......then this is an okay buy.  But don't expect it to perform with the high tech games that are available.......the processor speed is slow and ram is only 1/2 a gig.  Go to HP's or Dell's website and read the specs for their basic computers that will accommodate web surfing, downloading pictures and music and gaming. </content></review>
<review><summary> Awesome!!! </summary><name> msvee </name><date> 2009-11-25 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> This laptop is so awesome. I've always had a desktop, so I'm excited that I was able to purchase a laptop at such an inexpensive price. First of all, it's advertised as having 512MB RAM and a 40GB hard drive. Well, I got 1G of RAM and a 60 GB hard drive. Secondly, it works so well, as if it's new. And thirdly, for this to have been a refurbished computer, it looks good with very little to no scratches. Several people's comments have not been to pleasing, but I would blame the seller, not the laptop. I didn't purchase the cheapest one. I read all of the sellers' comments and chose the one I thought would give me an honest buy. I am very happy with my purchase. </content></review>
<review><summary> Product good but Do not buy it from BRAVTEK </summary><name> A. Rangarajan </name><date> 2009-06-08 </date><rating> 2 </rating><content> Decent product however I bought the laptop from BRAVTEK and I got cheated on the deal. He sold me a defective product and refused to fix it. Be careful shopping for laptops and by all means avoid the above vendor. </content></review>
<review><summary> Great Laptop! </summary><name> J. Bolton </name><date> 2009-05-27 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> This is a great laptop for the price.  It functions beautifully for basic use (school, work, surfing the web, etc.).  I have had absolutely no trouble with mine, and would highly recommend this product to everyday users. I've seen a couple of bad reviews simply because users purchased this computer with the intent to make it their "gaming" computer, and then were disappointed with the outcome.  Check the specs and your game requirements first.  If you truly want a gaming computer, you probably shouldn't be looking at Laptops in the first place.  It's a great computer at a reasonable price.  If you just need something for work, school, and surfing the web, it's perfect. </content></review>
<review><summary> sellers= good...products= fair </summary><name> Jumbojet </name><date> 2009-03-31 </date><rating> 2 </rating><content> Its not a bad laptop at all, my only disapointment is that it wont play dvd's, a file or program is missing. This was a letdown because I take long bus trips and wanted various ways to spend my time.It was a low price, In a way I wish I would have waited and got a more up to date laptop, but hey its still new to me.It is rather sluggish at times, it could have something to do with hot spots.I think I was exspecting more, but hey it was only $240.00 and it is 6 yrs oldat the time I was desperate, and you get what you pay for.one good thing it arrived fast, and I was able to track it. </content></review>
<review><summary> Functionable Laptop </summary><name> Dara H </name><date> 2009-03-29 </date><rating> 3 </rating><content> I got this thing used a few years ago; now, I'm a 16 year-old, and my primary use for computers is writing, storing my photos, and gaming. This laptop is pretty decent (especially for the price) for the first two of my purposes, but for gaming, it was way, way below par. We had to buy numerous upgrades for it to even run World of Warcraft on top of my pictures (they take up a lot of memory).BOTTOM LINE: If you're looking for a low-key laptop and you don't need much memory, this is a nice little piece of hardware. </content></review>
<review><summary> WARNING: DELL WILL NOT HONOR THEIR WARRANTY! </summary><name> Shawn Wale </name><date> 2009-03-05 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> I ordered a Dell Inspiron laptop 1 1/2 years ago and it worked great until recently.  The screen went black and the system would not start.  Turned out that the video card had failed.  I contacted Dell customer support to activate my next business day warranty and after more than a week I have gotten nowhere with them.  My claim has been "escalated" twice with the same excuses and refusal to fix the problem.  They claim they have no video cards in stock and I will have to wait 2-3 weeks for a replacement card, 2-3 weeks for a loaner system, or 2-3 weeks for a replacement system -- basically my NEXT DAY warranty is anything but.I explained that this is a mission critical system and a 2-3 week delay is unacceptable given the high price I paid for the next day warranty.  I offered to take another make or model of graphics card and even offered to go buy the card myself if the agreed to pay for it.  They refused to help in any way.  So, I am left with a useless laptop for 2-3 weeks until it becomes convenient for them to honor the warranty.  I will never buy another Dell product again and recommend that others who are not technically experienced with fixing computers or that need a "mission critical" system that they look elsewhere because Dell cannot be relied upon to fix broken systems in a timely manner. </content></review>
<review><summary> Not so great </summary><name> KORY A. SCHAUBHUT </name><date> 2008-08-01 </date><rating> 2 </rating><content> My laptop arrived with obvious signs of use, a non-functioning AC adapter, and no frills whatsoever... such as installation disks or user manuals.  All you get is the laptop and a power cable (that didn't work, in my case).  It was cheap, though. </content></review>
