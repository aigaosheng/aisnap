<review><summary> The real iPad Killer - APPLE SHOT THEMSELVES ON THE FOOT *READ DETAILS* </summary><name> E. Cortes </name><date> 2010-06-08 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> I was going to buy the iPad tomorrow. I started looking up information on it and then I found out that the unlimited data plan was removed for new users after June 7th. This is the biggest load of B.S. I ever heard. The whole point of the ipad is that you can have unlimited data, for web, apps and VIDEO!!!. Be prepared to pay exorbitant prices to watch video on the iPad. This plan is the iPad killer.New plans are250 MB	$14.992 GB	$25.00Steve Jobs, your propaganda about an unbelievable price is all lies! </content></review>

<review><summary> Surprisingly Versatile </summary><name> Matthew Nikkel </name><date> 2010-06-07 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> One of my favorite things about being an early adopter is when I pick up a device more for the novelty than anything else and I'm completely surprised by how useful it turns out to be. I had this experience first with my first iPod, when I discovered podcasts. I had it again when I first got a Kindle and my reading increased about 5 fold. And I've had it once more, in almost too many ways to count, with the iPad.Let me be clear, the iPad is not a computer. You can't do anything on it that you couldn't on a laptop or desktop PC. The difference with the iPad though, is that you'll find it allows you to many of those things in ways and places you would never bring a PC to. Let me give a few examples to better illustrate my point.A few days after I got my iPad, I discovered that it fit nearly perfectly on the reading ledge for my treadmill. Now my treadmill faces a blank wall, so up to this point workout entertainment has been strictly auditory. With the iPad though, I can now watch videos while I work out. The result, I've been exercising about twice as often in the three weeks since I bought my iPad.Another example. I used to love reading comics when I was younger. However, as an adult there's a certain stigma attached to having a comic book collection in the house. The Marvel and Xcomics apps on the iPad mean that I can now enjoy comics without actually having to keep them laying around my house. The result is that I've completely rediscovered a form of entertainment.One more example. The other night, while getting ready for bed with my wife, somehow the topic of old cartoon theme songs came up in conversation. I picked up the iPad from my nightstand and we spent about 30 minutes reminiscing over YouTube clips of old cartoons. Now you might say I could do the same thing with a laptop, which I could. However, my laptop wasn't in the room and it's unlikely I would have gone to fetch it simply on a whim. With a 4-5lb laptop, it more or less stays in one place unless I anticipate that there will be a need for it. With a 1.5lb iPad, it follows me wherever I go, almost always nearby should the need for it arise.Those are just 3 examples of how the iPad has proved useful in the short time I've had it. True, they're small things, but they add up quickly to form a completely different experience with a computing device than what I'm used to.Sure the device is not without its flaws. Flash would definitely be welcome. And I'd kill for a USB and SD slot. But the technical story of this device doesn't have a whole lot to do with what makes the experience of using it so special. It's a completely different computing experience, and trying to boil it down to a spec sheet comparison just doesn't do it justice. </content></review>
<review><summary> Disappointed </summary><name> Mark Linton </name><date> 2010-06-07 </date><rating> 3 </rating><content> The iPad is ok, but I was hoping for better.What I like: watching movies, reading books, battery life.What I tolerate: browsing (many little issues with Safari and most web pages that I read have many small links that are challenging to touch at the default page resolution), email (builtin mailer isn't very good at managing mailboxes, especially trying to avoid reading messages that might be spam), typing (a learning experience for a touch typist).What I dislike: most of the rest of the apps, builtin and third-party. The lack of a decent way to view photos in an album or read PDF (offline) is particularly annoying because those seem like things that would be good on the iPad. Conventional wisdom is the apps will get better, but a major issue is that the iTunes user interface to the Apple App Store is poor. Support for searching for apps and sorting results by user rating is particularly lacking. </content></review>
<review><summary> Review of 3G + 64GB Model </summary><name> MiRSD </name><date> 2010-06-07 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> I've had the iPad for about a month now, so I've had some time to play around with it.First off - the device is NICE looking. Much like a giant iPhone/iPod Touch, and in fact, if the iPod Touch had 3G and was 4x the size, I don't think you could tell the difference.The device shares the same OS (or a slight variation of it) and most of the iPhone/iPod Touches built in apps (although some are slightly modified such as Mail and Contacts to better fit the large screen). A great touch is that it runs MOST of the iPhone apps. Most? not all?? No -- some apps (I've figured out the hard way) are designed for iPhone only and will simply NOT WORK on the iPad. Be sure to check apps ahead of time to avoid disappointment! Emulation is decent, giving the option of either "boxing" around a 100% sized screen or "2x doubling" which fills the iPad screen. You either get the best quality at a lower size, or a full screen at a lower quality - a poor tradeoff (also, running iPhone apps at 4x their intended size looks very odd in some cases -- skype turns the iPad into a 10" phone display that looks like one of those joke remote controls they sell with the 4" buttons). iPad apps make much better used of the available space, but so far those apps are behind the iPhone counterparts that have been in development for years (and usually cost a bit more!). One big disappointment of running iPhone apps on the iPad are that they don't run the same! Photo editing apps, for example, save all photos at 640x480 on the iPad (but full resolution even on the original iPhone 2G). To edit photos and keep them at full resolution you need to use iPad specific apps (which again are not up to the point of iPhone apps).Much like the iPhone, almost everything needs to be done through iTunes (transferring movies and music, updating, syncing), so those of you who hate the program will need to just suck it  up for this one (even on my newer quad-core PC iTunes is a big resource hog, so I understand the pain!).The 3 sizes available (16GB, 32GB and 64GB) are before formatting - you get about 59GB usable on the 64GB model (which is expected if you've ever purchased a hard drive). Unfortunately there isn't any other storage option available, so if you buy 16GB and need more you'll need to delete stuff to free space.Overall speed of the product is very nice - I only have the original iPhone (2G) and with all of the updates over the last couple years it's really slowed it down. The iPad is blazing fast now, but I wonder how long it'll be before OS updates slow it down and you need the the 2nd generation iPad to get that speed back. Also, a big problem with the iPod Touch are that updates cost between $5-10. Will the same hold true for the iPad?The device is great for movies.. sometimes. It's closer to a 4:3 (fullscreen) aspect ratio than the iPhone (widescreen) so widescreen movies WILL display black bars (and those 2.40:1 movies like the Matrix will be mostly black bars). Movies will also quickly fill the iPad (coming in around 1.5 - 2.5GB a piece).Sound is a bit better than the iPhone, but still in a very poor position (one speaker, located at the bottom right of the iPad) - You'll want headphones for this thing.Wifi is nice, but what about away from the house? the option to even get 3G is another $129. On top of that you need to purchase a monthly plan (fortunately no contract!). Unfortunately, just a month or so after release, ATT has killed the option for Unlimited 3G and replaced it with a 2GB cap (you also have a 250MB plan available for a few bucks less). People who purchase the iPad by 6/7/2010 will be able to purchase the Unlimited plan but will only have the 250MB/2GB plan available if they cancel the unlimited plan and want to sign up again).A big disappointment are the included accessories. You'd expect something to come with it for the outrageous price it costs, right? No case, no dock, no headphones. Just a USB cable and wall adapter. Expect to cough up way more than necessary for a dock, headphones, case, etc.. I went with the A-frame for Ipad and Belkin F8N277tt Pleated Sleeve for iPad - Black , both very nice accessories.A great thing about it is being able to use the web without a computer. No more booting up the PC or bringing the laptop out of standby. The iPad is 'always on' and just takes a click to use it. That's the big selling point for me. The downside is that you lose all other functionality of a PC and have to resort to using available apps (more $$).A bit selling point for me was the Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit - being able to plug my DSLR into it, download photos, edit them using iPad apps and then upload them to flickr from anywhere! Problem is, the kit is more $$ (why not just add a USB slot to the thing?), the memory card adapter is SD only (not the popular Compact Flash found in DSLRs, so those people (myself) will need to plug a USB cable from the camera to the iPad camera kit to the iPad to download photos). More stuff to carry around!There are some very cool apps on it - I love being able to hold movies on a larger device than an iPhone. I love being able to put all my photos on there. I love being able to browse the web from anywhere. For that, I give it 4 stars.A couple last disappointments - the things a bit heavy (1.5LBs) and hard to angle anywhere. Trying to watch a movie and hold it isn't fun, and the stands aren't perfect (or usable in all situations). It's also big -- a little too big! Unlike an iPhone which can always be in your pocket, this thing needs its own bag that you have to bring with you. It's much like cameras -- a Point and shoot gets the job done and can go with you everywhere. A DSLR does a much better job, but being so bulky you can't take it with you all the time. </content></review>

<review><summary> iPad 16 GB wifi only </summary><name> Mohammad H. Farooqi </name><date> 2010-06-05 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> The iPad 16 gb wifi only is the best value for money in the iPad series. The screen display is absolutely gorgeous as well as the overall finishing quality of the product. Internet browsing, checking multiple mail accounts, watching videos and pictures, listening songs or just spending loads of time playing games and trying out loads n loads of fun filled applications is just an out of this world experience. Ofcourse you can't compare the ipad to a regular pc or a laptop (when it comes to heavy document or graphic processing) but for everything else specially while being on the move there's the iPad. </content></review>
<review><summary> I like it.. </summary><name> Dmitry Shishkin </name><date> 2010-06-05 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> I bought an iPad today and I think it is going to work for me pretty well. It is not going to replace my laptop (MacBook) in work related activities, but it is going to replace it in fun-related activities. After working on my laptop all day long, when I want to relax and do some casual internet browsing, reading, watch my photos, etc I want to move away from my desk without carrying my 5 lb laptop with me (and also unplugging it from an external monitor and bunch of other cables). iPad allows me to do exactly this. 1.5 lbs vs 5 lbs (MacBook Pro) is a big difference. Instant on makes a big difference as well. I used to use my iPod Touch for these purposes, but it is too small to browse the Internet comfortably, and overall its 3.5" screen is too tiny pretty much for antything. (It worked as a e-reader to me pretty well though).I spent a lot of time trying to find a nice netbook, but after looking at one that my friend bought I realized that this is not going to work - these are just small (and therefore inferior) versions of laptops. I gave Kindle a try, but did not really like it. I gave MacBook Air a really close look, but that thing is twice as heavy and three times as expensive. iPad is conceptually new device and it seems to fill a niche that Apple is trying to fill pretty nicely.Some people say iPad is just a big iPod Touch, and this is true - it is a larger and better iPod Touch. This is why I like it. Its screen is 4-5 times larger, and it is less than twice as expensive (as I recall the cheapest iPod upon its release was priced at $299). I would say this is how iPod Touch was supposed to be from the very beginning. I always felt that my iPod touch was too large for an mp3 player and too small for an internet browsing device. May be without knowing it, I became an Apple geek - now I have a Macbook, an iPad, an iPod Touch, and iPod Nano. Probably I will get rid of my iPod Touch, but the other three devices complete each other perfectly: MacBook is for work, iPad is for casual browsing, reading, and checking email, and iPod Nano is for music and audiobooks.I got my iPad, keeping this 14-days return policy in mind, but I am pretty sure I am going to keep it. A lot of critical things that were mentioned here are true: I wish the screen was not glossy, and I wish it was lighter (but lets be realistic - it is way lighter than all laptops and quite a bit lighter than most notebooks), and I wish it could play Adobe flash videos. This is pretty much it - I don't see anything else that bothered me about this device. And there are tons of things that make me happy about it: a beautiful screen, quick response, external speakers (I really missed them on m iPod Touch), and as mentioned before - instant on.Looking back, I really feel that a lot of negative reviews that I've read did not make much sense - this device should be judged for what it is, not for what it could have been.. </content></review>
<review><summary> A lawyer looks at an iPad </summary><name> G. Ware Cornell Jr. </name><date> 2010-06-04 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> When I started trying cases in the seventies and into the eighties, I would take yellow legal pads to trial. By the end of the trial they would be full of rather cryptic notes for jury selection, opening statement, witnesses, and closing argument. By the nineties, I was a computer-savvy guy who sometimes rented a laptop for big trials, but usually relied a never ending supply of legal pads.By the millennium, I had a PC tablet on which I could load electronic copies of the files and depositions, and take notes during trial. I could actually walk about about the courtroom with it just like it was a very heavy legal pad. After I switched my office's computers from PCs to Macs. I would still bring it to trials. Then my tablet died (as most Windows machines are want to do) and I was back stuck at the lectern with my MacBook Pro. When I wanted to wander the courtroom while examining witnesses, I had to use my trusty old legal pad. Like many Mac enthusiasts I prayed for the day Apple would offer a tablet.For me that day came on April 27, when my 64GB WiFi+3G iPad was delivered. Since then I bring it to court in lieu of my laptop. Unlike my old Tablet PC, 3G gives me constant and immediate Internet access. And that is the principal reason to opt for the 3G over the WiFi only iPad. Many courthouses do not have hotspots. If you don't need Internet wherever you are, then the other model may be enough. As to storage, more memory  is better. You are going to want to load, movies, music and photos on it. 32GB is not enough. Given the marginal increments in costs of doubling the memory 64GB, the present maximum will seem tiny as the iPad evolves over the years. If you get it now, you may be able to postpone upgrading a year from now.The iPad, like the iPhone is basically a Swiss Army knife, and like the Swiss knife it is infinitely customizable. As a Mac user I am comfortable with iWork, Apples Office Suite. Consisting of Pages, Numbers, and Keynote each applications for the iPad, they all read Microsoft Office files (Word, Excel and PowerPoint) and export them. You will want to buy them. Other critical work apps include Evernote, iAnnotatate PDF, PaperDesk, Penultimate, Dropbox and GoodReader. I track my expenses on the go with an iPhone app JetSet. On the fun side I read books using Kindle for iPad, which I prefer to Apples's iBook. On the negative side, at the moment the iPad lacks multi-taking, and has no camera. That will change. But waiting for those additions is no excuse not to get an iPad today.My iPad is a tool not a toy, I keep telling myself. And as a courtroom tool, it is small and light just like a yellow legal pad.  But when I stroll about with my iPad, I can't help having a big smile on my face. </content></review>
<review><summary> Amazing Product! Better Then Any Netbook! </summary><name> Barbara Winchel </name><date> 2010-06-02 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> I have the 16 GB Wifi iPad, and I absolutely love it! It's amazing what you can do with it! I have photos, music, mucic videos, games, Pages, Keynote, iBooks and more on it, and I still have over 12.5 GB of free space left! It's awesome! A must buy! This is way better then any netbook, and I'm a HP fan! And the volume on here is really awesome too! The only thing that isn't so awesome about the iPad is the price. I think it should be $400.00. But still, don't let the price stop you from owning this amazing device! </content></review>
<review><summary> Lacks Functionality </summary><name> David </name><date> 2010-06-02 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> I bought one of these iPads from the Apple store in the mall as a replacement to my 8 year old Toshiba tablet and all I can say it wow, the iPad really lacks functionally and the ability to do multitasking. My 8 year old tablet has more space and more functionally then this has by far. I ended up taking it back and getting a refund, I'm more then happy with my old tablet that is far superior to this product. </content></review>
<review><summary> Best quote ever: "A solution in search of a problem". </summary><name> M.D.C. </name><date> 2010-06-02 </date><rating> 3 </rating><content> a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OXE9257LTD08"Watch Video Here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OXE9257LTD08/a You can thank me later.  For summary judgment skip to the very bottom.  I'll add a video review once I get settled.I bought an iPad just so I could review it.  Figuring that it would be one of the more popular reviews out there, I decided that it would be in my best interest to take the time to run it through its paces.  And you know what I've discovered?  It really IS an oversized iPod Touch.  No, I'm serious - right down to the functionality within, the navigation, even the Settings menu, it's clear that they took the iPod Touch (or rather, the iPhone OS) and tweaked a few settings, enlarged some others, and slapped it onto a form factor reminiscent of, as one person put it, an iPod Touch ran over by a steamroller.  For crying out loud, the iPad even runs iPod Touch and iPhone apps in their native resolutions, it's like looking at the apps on those devices!But, I digress.  The first thing that I noticed about this device was the fact that everyone seemed to want it, yet really didn't know why.  I and a colleague spent weeks trying to identify a single use case for the iPad; I even went out on a limb long before I laid hands on one and said that the iPad is effectively a toy.  Now that I've used it, that's exactly what it is: a toy.  It's not for those who want to get things done.  It's for those who want a pastime.  Now mind you, there's nothing wrong with that - but that's a fact.  I also like to say that it's a jack of all trades yet master of none, which is also a factual statement.  Next thing I noticed was the blatantly excessive setup steps which are more the fault of iTunes than the iPad.  See, if you're a MacBook owner, you're asked to sign up for iTunes when you first set up the laptop.  That's the same process for any Apple device that runs iTunes even if you don't plan on using it on a regular basis.  The problem is that iTunes is not smart enough to detect and merge duplicate accounts.  Obviously, if I've got two accounts with the same email address, it's probably a good bet that they belong to the same person unless the name is different, which it isn't.  iTunes registered my email address from when I owned an iPod Touch, yet used my username from my MacBook, even though the email address is the exact same.  The problem is that iTunes attaches your download history to the username, not to the email address.  This wouldn't otherwise be an issue, but for the fact that you can't even start using the iPad until you attach it to a Mac and connect via iTunes to activate it.  The problem is the account that it uses to do said activation vs. the account that has the stuff you wanted.You can probably see where this is going. - I had bought a number of apps on the iPod Touch, and thought I could download them again at any time (email address);- I had created a number of podcasts on the MacBook (username, or so I thought);- I tried to get iBooks, Kindle, Amazon Mobile and Netflix on the iPad along with all of the above (email address, or so I thought).First the iPad wouldn't sync properly.  It gave me a list of everything (both from the email address and the username) but wouldn't download content from either.  Then it told me to activate the MacBook for access to the apps.  Did that, and tried again.  The iPad still wouldn't sync the apps.  I tried to download them directly from the iPad; it attempted a download, then sat there.  I had to clear out the iTunes account on the iPad (which was the username), log out of iTunes on the MacBook (which was the username), then log back into both with the email address, which then allowed me to get the apps, though slow.  But then I couldn't get the podcasts or some music I had bought.  Had to repeat and log in with the username to get those to sync.  After much futzing I got everything set up - 2 hours of my life wasted to set up.  Probably not an issue if you'd never owned a MacBook or an iPod or an iPhone or anything like that.  Basically, if you'd never used iTunes it would probably go smoother as you'd not have anything to transfer.Let's get down to it, shall we?  I approach this review in terms of use case, so for you, find the use case that applies, and see if the statement is enough to deter (or encourage) you.My first thought:- THIS MIGHT BE A GREAT DEVICE TO HAVE AT THE AIRPORT, ON THE PLANE, AT THE HOTEL, ETC!...this was hard to debunk, but I managed to do it.  First of all, it IS a fun device for those places, but the limitations hold it back from the greatness that it could have been if it were to have a full flavor of Snow Leopard rather than an iPhone OS derivative.  Let me explain:  Most important, the device is too heavy to be carried and held for extended periods.  Because the entire back is aluminum, and because the screen is so thick, nevermind the battery, it doesn't lend itself to being held for a long time.  Yes, I know there are docks.  But if you're going to just dock the thing you might as well bring the laptop along.  Additionally, there were minor issues with the WiFi - I didn't have the "refuse to reconnect" issue.  What I experienced was unusual slowness from two different hotspots: my Mobile Hotspot, and my home wireless.  My Mobile Hotspot has run GoToMeetings.  It's not a slouch.  Yet, for some reason, iTunes struggled to open and was unbearably slow, as was Kindle.  Yet, on a netbook that I recently sold, on the same hotspot, Kindle was reasonably quick and snappy.  I know why there was a difference...the apps on the iPad are very graphics-rich and it's clear that it wants at least medium (3Mbps down) speeds on the WiFi for an optimal experience.  It works, but it's just not fun to wait 20 minutes for a book to download, I mean really.My next thought (initiated by a co-worker):- THIS COULD BE A GREAT DEVICE FOR RECEIVING AND SENDING DOCUMENTS TO CO-WORKERS!!...except for one small problem: interacting with Microsoft networks is nigh impossible, and file management is non-existent.  The only way to get a file on the device is to have it emailed to you or otherwise sent through MobileMe or iTunes.  If the data is sensitive there's no way to get it securely to your device (unless you have secure email screening services), since the iPad does not have any exterior ports for storage devices.  What's worse, since it's not running Snow Leopard, it means no VMWare, no Office 2008, no Office Online.  As much as some would hate to admit it, Microsoft Office dominates the workspace, and if a device cannot interact with those documents, it makes it hard to justify.  Even if the device can do other things, it's yet another (heavy) device to carry along with the user's regular computer/books/etc.My next thought (initiated by a co-worker):- COLLEGE STUDENTS COULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM SOMETHING LIKE THIS!!...I did read the Seton Hall announcement about giving all of their students iPads and MacBook Pros.  It must be nice to have so much money to throw around - and I suspect they're taking it out of the loans that the students are ponying up to attend, but I'm guessing that this one depends.  I mean, on one hand, yes, the convenience of being able to pull out a device and research something really quick might be a boon.  It also might be convenient to be able to listen to broadcasts or see webinars that have been posted on iTunes.  On the other hand, some colleges might not care much for the potential cheating that the iPad seems to encourage by its open access.  Of course, "guns don't kill people", but you see what I'm getting at.My next thought:- WOW!! A COLOR TABLET EREADER!!...and yes, it is this, and does it fairly well, but then you run into the problem of cost-benefit.  Some would justify it by saying "yeah, but it can do other things!!" which is true, but I don't look at it that way; if all I wanted to do is read books, I would get an eReader (I actually bought a Kindle a while ago.  Great device).  In order for me to justify a purchase, it has to be spot on with what I intend to use it for.  If I can't find a viable use case, I can't justify its price.  In truth, I couldn't justify buying it this time, but for the need to actually review it and attempt to help others with my experience.  But back on topic, the big issue with the reader is threefold: first, iBooks is terrible.  It screams "gimmick" from the moment you launch your first book.  Looks extremely well made, but there were some bad framerate issues when flipping pages, and I found myself wishing I could disable the animation.  Then there was Kindle, which thankfully didn't have the page flip animation, and what's more, Kindle showed how much more evolved it was than iBooks by virtue of it giving you freebie books and userguides along with the software, unlike iBooks which let you stare at a blank bookshelf.  The second thing to decide is whether or not the backlit LCD works for you.  Some are sensitive to it and prefer the eInk display.  I'll tell you this much - if you're trying to read outdoors, the iPad automatically loses!  It also loses in battery life AND multitasking, believe it or not ( the Kindle allows you to play music while reading while still managing to pull out days of use without the need to recharge ).So on and so forth...try as I might, I could not find a viable use case for the iPad.  It does so much and yet so little.  It's a very specific market that could truly benefit, but at that narrow of a market target, the price is a bit steep.  It's not way out there on this model, but definitely on the 3Gs.  In other words readers:-=- What the iPad does RIGHT -=-- Convenience.  Powers on quick, ready to use at your beckon call.- Navigation is smooth, no real hickups on the interface that I could tell.- Tight integration with iTunes allows you to get books, magazines, movies, trailers, games, etc. at the push of a few buttons.- Decent speaker volume for watching movies or trailers, even has an equalizer to adjust the output quality.- The screen is brilliant and vibrant and easy on the eyes (but see WRONG below).- The 16GB model isn't that overpriced considering the technology (Which has been measured to cost about $250 to make).-=- What the iPad does WRONG -=-- Weight.  It's a heavy device, a VERY heavy device not meant to be held for long periods of time.- Glossy screen - just like the MacBook Pros, they just don't believe in matte or at least polarized screens; this thing is a straight up mirror in broad daylight.  Might consider an overlay.- No external ports i.e. DisplayPort, HDMI, USB, etc.  Yes, there's a dock port, but you know what I mean.  A DisplayPort would not have hurt Apple.- Initial setup is cumbersome if you are trying to add all of your previously purchased content.- iPhone/iPod Touch apps are stretched with no optimization or smoothing.- Because it's based on iPhone OS and not Snow Leopard, or at least a slimmer version thereof, it's extremely limited in productivity; not quite feasible for a workplace replacement device.- WiFi seems extremely slow; there are reports of WiFi issues across the web, so it may be an antenna problem with the first gens.  As we all know, Apple likes to use first adopters as guinea pigs and then release the good stuff later.- It truly IS an oversized iPod Touch.  The look, the feel, the navigation, the limitations, all are identical to those found on the Touch.  The only difference is the larger screen, which for some is more than sufficient, but I consider this a negative, because it doesn't stand apart much from the Touch, and it should.So...in summary, do I recommend it?  Well...depends.  The answer is an emphatic "NO" if you're looking for something to replace your PC entirely.  It's not happening.  It's a soft "YES" if you accept that the device is a fun add-on that is not going to replace anything - something to pass time, or accompany you on your travel or something.  As long as you are ok with that then it won't disappoint you.  But don't expect a laptop out of this thing. </content></review>

Haggard </name><date> 2010-05-28 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> You are either going to pick this up and love it, or pick it up and wonder what the heck it is.For me this is a great product. If you have an iphone or an ipod touch you know how to use it, it really is just bigger. Although it's faster and easier to use because the keyboard is larger and there is more screen area to use for applications. i bought the Wifi model initially and loved it. I put my movies, music, games, RSS readers on it and never looked back. The iPad truly is a great device. I imagine that there may be other brand coming out but in today's marketplace the iPad is the best portable computer I have seen. Some people say that it has flaws, I have only run into one website that I frequently use that didn't work, and that was CNN. All other sites I visit have changed their video formats over to html5 or other ipad friendly formats. Flash not running on here is really not a big deal for my applications.This makes a fantastic book reader as well. I've actually read more in the last few weeks with this then I had in the last few years. It makes reading so accessible because no matter where you are if you have a few minutes you can pull up a book, read a chapter and then move on without having to carry a book around. This is a fantastic product, I can't say enough about it. So why did I give it 4 stars? Because it's a bit heavy, and that's the only reason. But if you consider the battery life in my experience has easily been 10-14 hours without a charge you realize that's why it's heavy. It is so nice being able to have a computer that you can literally use all day and still not be able to exhaust the battery.Great product. </content></review>
<review><summary> Great device for those looking for a netbook alternative! </summary><name> Hoppaguy </name><date> 2010-05-26 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> First, as some background, I am not a so called "Apple" person. I think I might be the only person that does not own an iPhone or any other Apple product. However, I was looking for a netbook and was intrigued by the iPad. I checked it out in the store and then went to a friend's house to play around with his. I was sold when I saw the Netflix app whereby you could stream your instant queue. I also thought the user interface was incredibly easy. So easy that I am planning on getting one for my mom who has never used a computer.I have been using it for 2 weeks now and the device is doing everything I would want from checking email to surfing the Internet. I am also watching television and movies on it and trying out the different apps. I have actually taken it to the store now because the epicurious app is great and I just shop for the recipes in the store. The only downside and the loss of 1 star is the lack of a front facing camera. I would have like to be able to use Skype on this device and most netbooks have this capability. I am sure Apple will put this in the next version and will certainly upgrade when that happens. </content></review>
<review><summary> Not Great! But It Does What It Does! </summary><name> D.W. </name><date> 2010-05-25 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> I brought this item from the Apple website, I had to wait weeks before I got it. It's fast, easy to use, and plays video, but not flash. Of course, I use it to surf the web, check email, and make small purchases. All in all, this is a pretty neat item. Not to replace a laptop, or a netbook, but something to carry around the home, instead of some bulky laptop, or netbook. Looking forward to more apps, and feature updates. When I'm not using it, it makes a great digital picture frame. Battery life is descent, not to meantion connectivity, it's descent. Don't expect much though, all in all, I like my Apple Ipad. </content></review>

<review><summary> Warning! </summary><name> Timothy J. Heile </name><date> 2010-05-23 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> If your computer doesn't have an Intel chip in it, DO NOT BUT AN IPAD! It will not sync with your computer. I have been a lifelong Apple fan, and this has upset me so much that I will never buy another Mac product. I have a perfectly good Mac G5 desktop with a PowerPC chip in it. It's a bit older, but it's in great shape and I record all of my music on it. I bought the Ipad for my wife the day before our 3 week vacation, assuming it would be plug and play just like all my other Mac purchases. Not only was it not plug and play, it doesn't sync at all with my computer and it never will. I called the Apple help line, and they told me I basically have to buy a new computer that has an Intel chip in it. Nice trick Apple - if you want to lose customers. My wife loves the Ipad, but we are hugely disappointed in Apple for doing this to us. </content></review>
<review><summary> A nice gadget but not for serious use </summary><name> David Noonan </name><date> 2010-05-23 </date><rating> 3 </rating><content> I've had my iPad for a few days. I like the limited mobility it gives me to read e-mail or news while wandering the house. I love the touch screen (most of the time) and being able to flick between pages or quickly scroll through a list. It does have some serious limitations though.The wifi sucks. It will be fine one minute and then say it's not connected. It also frequently loses the wifi password so I get to type that in two or three (or more) times every day. There are three laptops and a netbook in the house that don't have any wifi problems. I found an Apple support article that said this problem was only with WEP, nope, I'm using WPA2. Also, be sure to down the user guide to iBooks (it's free) because the help files are all online which isn't helpful when the wifi won't work.The keyboard is usable as long as you don't need numbers or punctuation. Since those require that you switch to the "other" keyboard and then switch back you shouldn't plan on doing any real work on it. It's fine for chatting or quick e-mails but anything else is a major annoyance. Spending 30 seconds fiddling with the cursor when you just need to move over one space is very frustrating. The mobile browser is pretty lame. It doesn't support a feature that Google Docs and many other sites use to edit content so don't plan on making changes on those online documents. It also won't change font sizes, yes, you can zoom in but that doesn't reflow the text so you'll be scrolling to read the end of the line. It's not huge as flicking around the screen is easy but it's annoying. Web sites with crowded interfaces can be frustrating as it's easy to click the link next to the one you wanted. Fingers don't make good precision pointing devices. Also the book organization seems lame but I haven't really played with it yet.There's also the form factor. It's too heavy to hold for a long period and laying down isn't always a good solution. You should also plan on getting a case that doubles as a stand, preferably two-way (horizontal and vertical). I wish someone would make one that included a shoulder strap as it's very awkward to carry.Overall I think that it's a pretty slick gadget though given what it does, and doesn't do, I think it's seriously over priced. If you're okay with touchpads and small keyboards you're probably better off with a netbook. If you want to do real work get a laptop. If you just want to read the news and e-mail at the kitchen table (and your access point is really close) then this might be a great gadget for you. Just don't plan to edit any Google Docs.----PS. Reading Kindle books is much, much better on the iPad than on the Kindle. The touch screen makes a HUGE difference. </content></review>
<review><summary> Regret buying it </summary><name> A. Yeomans </name><date> 2010-05-23 </date><rating> 2 </rating><content> I think I hopped on the bandwagon way too soon. I saw this device at my local Best Buy and like a lamb being led to the slaughter, I foolishly bought it not realizing what I was getting into. I was not aware it could not handle the multitasking I thought it could. I was so excited that I was not aware that it was missing a camera and I thought I would be able to ditch my smartphone but reality hit me tha I can't even talk on this thing even with the 3G iPad. Then when I wanted to download an application, it wouldn't work, I then realized that I had to go through iTunes on my other computer which I had to deauthorize in order to use my iTunes songs on the iPad. The iPad looks nice but I am seriously disappointed with it now, even the gaming experience is not what they make it seem and I thought I'd get a better hang of the racing games but no matter how much I try, it's just not ergonomical for games that I like in the first person unless somebody comes up with a fix for this. I noticed it also has become increasingly heavy just to hold like a book, a fact I overlooked in my initial excitement. Maybe by the end of the year Apple will be more in tune and offer multitasking and other features that I get on my notebook, but the 500 bucks I spent is now virtually money thrown away because I am Jonesing for something better for the iPad or just a better version of it. </content></review>
<review><summary> Ill pass this device with a C grade seems like a oversized Ipod Touch </summary><name> Darin T. </name><date> 2010-05-22 </date><rating> 3 </rating><content> Went to the apple store to play with it for a couple hours. Most of the hype or the reviews on the Internet are probably written by fanboys or people paid to write them. On a good note there is a plus to being a oversized Ipod touch or Iphone. The applications you download from the App store have more features a larger screen means a better Internet browsing experience. I watched a episode of dexter or at least part of it on Netflix  it looked nice. I just dont get why Steve Jobs found it necessary to says this was a revolutionary device or what not. Revolutionary was the Iphone OS system. This is not revolutionary its like buying a 60 inch tv compared to a 20 inch. I did not use the physical keyboard which you can buy. I did not like the virtual keyboard one bit on the Ipad, with all of the money apple makes the physical keyboard could have been thrown in for free. I mean they have the Chinese making these Ipads for pennys on the dollar in labor cost.Features such as a camera, webcam, regular Ac port, and dedicated USB port, and other ports were neglected lame move by Apple I hate how they hold out on these features but what can I say sony Hp ect ect is no better its just smart marketing so they can save these features for a future generation. I think the hip-ster image that Apple has created over the years is diminishing with the recent leaking of the Iphone 4 and the reports of all of the suicides committed by their Chinese workers. Im not a Apple basher I own the Touch and a Macbook Pro and a couple of Ipods. My point being until they come out with something really revolutionary I see the Ipad as a trendy device. If you have 500 or 600 dollars to blow go for it. But for the consumer on a budget it may be wise to go to Best Buy or Apple store for a couple of hours to use it yourself. You may think its the best thing since sliced bread. Also on a good note if I had to compare the Ipad to a Kindle which I have never used, it seems like a smarter choice to buy the Ipad since you would have more of a complete overall device. I guess reading books on a screen never seemed appealing to me. Some more facts about the I pad is that its quite heavy I believe it weighs in at a pound and a half. It would be a ideal machine to use while your laid out on the couch or on a lazy boy. I think my bottom line is when you read the reviews on other sites that give the Ipad 5 stars just remember that these reviews may be biased because Apple d has the extra money to buy a couple bias reviews in their favor. Yet like I said many people do think that the Ipad is great just not me. Also steer clear of buying cases and other accessories for any one of your apple devices at their Apple stores, you can find most of them at a 30 percent here on Amazon or other websites. Hope this helped if so give me a positive rating. </content></review>
<review><summary> No flash is a huge deal </summary><name> W. Wagner </name><date> 2010-05-21 </date><rating> 2 </rating><content> The iPad is sexy, but that wears off in a hurry. I thought that not having Flash would be a nit. Why do I need fancy advertisements that wiggle? It is a huge issue. Boeing won't even let you onto it's 747 website using an iPad. CNBC has lots of pages that aren't available. I don't know if Apple is arrogant or if they have a fundamental misunderstanding of the Internet. Based on my own experience with the 64mb Wifi model, it was a waste of money. </content></review>
<review><summary> What's there to like? </summary><name> moflaher </name><date> 2010-05-21 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> I bought the iphone.  It's pretty good for what it is.  I have always been frustrated that the iphone dose not support flash - but hey, it's a phone.  But the IPad is sold as a portable PC.  That it is not.  Here are several reasons NOT to buy it.1) The biggest failing and number one reason to NOT buy this device - you can't multitask.  Really?!  Can't use media player and work a word processor?! Year 2010 and no multi-tasking?!  Apple claims to not use Flash because they claim it slows portable devices down.  That's because they are putting the cheapest processor they can find into the IPad.  Oh, the bench marks also counter Apple's claim.2) You can't use any other browser or any browser of your choice.  NO, YOU DON"T have a choice! This is NOT an open system.  You can only use what Apple tells you to use.3) What?! No Flash?  Really?!  There will never be support for any other software either - like Silverlight.  Only closed end Apple software.  4) You can only get the software Apple is willing to sell you.5) ATT is the only carrier.  6) No USB port?My suggestion would be to wait for the HP Slate.  Very similar but you will get all of the above with a far faster processor, the ability to choose any carrier, an you can use any browser with the full support of flash and many other web tools. </content></review>

<review><summary> Ipad Vs. Kindle + Netbook </summary><name> Indian </name><date> 2010-05-20 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> The ipad screen is bright which is not too good for serious reading for hours. Also, it IS heavy if you were to hold it for more than 15-20 mins (if you put a cover on it, it is heavier!), and if you were to buy a stand for it, then why not by a netbook instead? Those things stand by themselves (in more ways than one!). For example, reading on ipad is fine for about 15 mins, after which both your eyes and your arms start to ache (I have done this), and you have an urge to put it down. I am sure you can read from the ipad for long periods of time just to prove a point, but is it enjoyable as on  a Kindle?I own a Kindle 2 and a Asus netbook (with 1.66GHz processor, 250GB HD, webcam, WIFI, Bluetooth and all the bells and whistles), both bought from Amazon. It cost me about $600 total and I get exactly what I need. I can video chat, transfer my photos directly, watch Netflix, do some real work, read news papers, magazines and comics (there is an app for that on Windows too!!).I can add 3G if I want to. Is there something I cannot do on my netbook? And for serious reading, I have my kindle. For those of you who have not used Kindle, you can transfer files onto kindle directly, since it shows up as a disk drive. No such thing is possible on the ipad, where you have to deal with itunes. If you are serious about reading, go with Kindle and if you want a small portable computer go with a netbook.P.S. By the way, you can read epub books (and every other possible format imaginable) on any netbook. They look just as good. And try Calibre for ebook library management. It is a free software and it rocks! </content></review>
<review><summary> iPad will make your life easier and keep you entertained non stop, </summary><name> Porfie Medina </name><date> 2010-05-20 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> I have had the Ipad 64g 3G for a little over two week and I'm still just as addicted to it as I was the first day. I was familiar with most of the features because I have the Ipod Touch and iPhone 3G. With the Ipad you get the best internet experience on any mobile device period. Of course what would the Ipad be without the actual Ipod which plays music, video, and podcasts. You get wifi but I recommend spending a little more for the iPad 3G which means you can use your iPad anywhere besides wifi spots courtesy of Atandt. The price of their data plans for the ipad are very affordable when compared to most other data services. The 3G models have GPS for location-based services, which means you get more accurate directions than the wifi only version. The App Store turns your Ipad in to a entertainment powerhouse. With the app store you can add apps that fit your needs. From games to business you're bound to find something that you will like. You get an amazing book reader with the ibook store, and if you download the amazon kindle app you get another great ebook reader app with many more books to choose from. It is still kind of bizarre to think I can watch a movie, listen to music, surf the internet, play games, read a book, write and read email, get GPS directions, watch you tube videos, check the weather, and even use the iPad as a phone over wifi with the Skype app. My favorite iPad apps are Netflix, abc player, pandora, Amazon kindle app, shazam and a few others. The apple iPad 3g is truly magical and is light years ahead of the competition with its ease of use and versatility. Sure there are things that can be improved (add a camera, add more internal memory and support adobe flash), but that's with anything. When apple finally releases it's update for iPad this fall which will include the ability to multitask (among many other cool features) it will bring a whole new functionality in to the iPad. I cant wait to be able to listen to pandora in the background while i surf the net or read a book.Like it or not the iPad is a revolution and created a whole new device category and will do for tablets what the ipod and iphone did for mp3 players and cell phones. </content></review>

<review><summary> I Love My iPad </summary><name> T. Mardall </name><date> 2010-05-19 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> With the exception of the unfortunate name,  I love my iPad. All of the software that I've bought or downloaded for free works great. It hasn't frozen, or even slowed down once. I've already written two multi-page papers using Apple's Pages program and the onscreen keyboard, which is surprisingly easy to use. While writing a paper and doing research online, interspersed with playing several games, watching a NetFlix movie and checking my email, I got a full 11.5 hours out of the battery without having to plug it in. It's light, easy to carry, great around the house and outside.  I've already gotten rid of my pocket pc and my GPS, and haven't had to power up my laptop since I got it.  Now here's the real kicker, my somewhat elderly mother, who is technologically challenged, even likes to use it, she went and ordered one, saying that it is so much easier to use then her laptop and iPod. ( She checks email and cruises the internet on her laptop, and thinks the larger screen is much easier to see then her iPod )  I recommend this to any and all.  This really is a great device. </content></review>
<review><summary> Merely a glorified Touch, but try to read a piano score with your iPod </summary><name> Samuel Chell </name><date> 2010-05-19 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> If you've ever owned or checked out a Touch, the iPad is merely a bigger version.  But therein lies a world of difference.  After trying out all of the features of my Touch--the e-mail, the apps, the movies, photos, books, and iTune downloads, the internet, the calendar, calculator, contact book, alarm, etc., etc., I stopped using practically all of them.  They were ingeniously implanted in this miniature device but too tiny for my impatient fingers and hungry eyes to waste time on.  I still love my Touch and have it on my person constantly--for music.  But with the iPad, suddenly all of those marvelous features that were little more than "possibilities" on the Touch are realities--plain, immediate, and practical, ready for action the instant you get your hands on this amazingly lightweight and user-friendly device.  Moreover, for a modest monthly fee you have the ability to use it anywhere, wi-fi not required.The device is so good I'm tempted to follow my wife's example and buy one.  You don't need this thing, but you may need a rationalization.  Hers was its usefulness in her mathematics classroom (she's already using it in conjunction with an overhead projector)--which was a bit of a stretch this late in the school year.  I've decided for the present to come up with the main rationalization NOT to get it--cost, and the impracticality of a "virtual" keyboard for a compulsive typist like me.But if Apple doesn't come out with the perfect netbook soon (it should be easy--simply attach a keyboard/cover to an iPad), I may have to submit to yet another decadent pleasure.  I had sworn off more clutter, but this latest Apple product has the potential to bring out the Eve and Adam in the most abstemious among us. </content></review>
<review><summary> Students! iPad is not a replacement of textbook! </summary><name> V. Wong </name><date> 2010-05-18 </date><rating> 3 </rating><content> I bought iPad because of I am tired of carring my textbooks. The screen is too small for figures and diagram. I was tired of using my finger moving the screen. Also hard to take note. I am a student and it is no way a replacement of actual textbook. So I sold it and bought a tablet PC with Windows 7 premium. The tablet PC configuration is better as a textbook replacement. Granted, it is also twice as much as iPad.To be fair, iPad was never developed as a textbook replacement.

<review><summary> iPad is my first Apple product and I love it </summary><name> Cat </name><date> 2010-05-17 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> The first time I saw the iPad was when it was announced with much fanfare and I was instantly smitten.  I've never been an Apple person and have stayed away from their products like crazy, but this thing really stuck in my mind.  Once it was released I went to the Apple store and played with it, like so many other people, and I walked away still liking it.  I figured I would play with it and walk away thinking that it wasn't worth the money or didn't work the way I wanted it to.  I was wrong.  I found myself looking up reviews just about everyday seeing what other people thought about it and finally happened to be in a store when they had some in stock and I took the plunge.  Was I nervous?  Yes.  Was I afraid that it would just be a toy and that was it?  Yes.  Was I scared about the price?  Yes.  However, I typically feel that way before any large electronics purchase.  What I have found in the month I've owned my iPad is that I carry it with me all over the house.  If I'm reading something on the internet and need to go in the other room....I take my iPad.  A lot of people have been bashing the iPad without every really using one and I can honestly say that it has changed how I consume entertainment.  It's not a replacement for a laptop or netbook, though it certainly could replace a lot of things that you use them for, but it is its own "thing".  When it really clicked for me was about a week ago.  It was a lazy Saturday afternoon and I was home by myself.  I was using the Netflix app to catch up on a show that I had missed a few episodes of and I started out watching it on the couch.  Soon I carried my iPad into the kitchen with me to make lunch.  Then went outside and sat on the deck.  I even took it into the bathroom with me....never having to stop watching the show.  The iPad haters out there would say that they could do the same thing with their laptop, but the iPad battery is so great that it gave me true freedom to move about the house without worrying about wires, batteries or anything else.  This is the true value of the iPad to me.  I can consume entertainment/information anywhere in the house instead of having to stay in one place.  Before I would either go to the office or sit on the couch to browse the internet with the laptop.  That way I had a power cord nearby.  With a 10 hour battery, I don't worry about that anymore.  Now, will it replace my need for a laptop?  No.  There are things I still need to do that will require more storage or programs that cannot be done on the iPad.  However, I'm okay with that.  If you are someone that spends a lot of time on your computer looking up things on the internet or watching movies or just wasting time.  You will be amazed at the freedom you feel with the iPad. </content></review>

I mean literally, a big price :-)It is worthy of 5 Stars due to the vast things you can do. Video, music, pix.But not like every phone or iPod. This is completely different.This is nearly perfect. </content></review>
<review><summary> Crippled Bluetooth functionality </summary><name> hrbud </name><date> 2010-05-17 </date><rating> 2 </rating><content> I won't repeat what other reviewers already mentioned.  I would've given the iPad a 4 or 5 star except for the crippled Bluetooth.  The iPad CAN'T connect to a Bluetooth GPS nor your cellphone using dialup networking.  Why?  So you would buy a 3G version and pay monthly fees to ATandT instead.  Big BOO to Apple for putting ATandT ahead of it's customers.   Of course, if you have a cellphone that can act as a wifi router (like Win mobile, symbian with joikuspot, android 2.2) you can have the iPad use it, but this drains the battery significantly, unlike Bluetooth that can last the entire day. </content></review>

<review><summary> A small step for man, the leap has yet to come </summary><name> Sonjacadogan </name><date> 2010-05-16 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> I have spent more than a week using the iPad and have found many pros and cons which should be considered before purchasing one.Pros: - The opening and closing of applications is very fast making the device very responsive.Watching Youtube video is very much better and clearer than on a PC or iMac.  Sound from the speakers is only OK, however the use of headphones would be recommended. As one who has not the best eyesight, I have found the screen size and quality far superior to that of the iPod or iPhone and a whole lot easier on the eyes.  The visual quality while looking at photos is excellent.  The iPad has freed me to do the basic things I enjoy doing e.g. Facebook and internet browsing without tying up the family's iMac. This has certainly lead to peace of mind in that quarter.Cons: -The device cannot have multiple applications running concurrently, therefore you cannot switch between them with any ease. The lack of Flash support has been somewhat irritating and should be taken into consideration.  As a business tool, the iPad should not be considered a replacement of a notebook or laptop.  A PC, iMac or laptop would be far more preferable.  I have used an app called "DocsAnywhere" and imported files via iTunes, which I found useful.  I was able to review said files while traveling by train to a meeting.  Of course, I also brought my laptop along for the journey.  I would prefer to use the iPad to control syncing with iTunes rather than the other way around, other than having to change the settings in iTunes to forestall this happening. Battery life is as promised although recharging is rather slow while connected to a PC or iMac, however recharging will halt if the parent machine goes into power down mode.  Future: -The iPad table may well be the forerunner of a technology which will replace portable computers for business use, but that day is not here yet and will not be for some time to come.  Conclusion: - For the casual user, I would say that the device is useful for email, Facebook, Youtube and internet browsing. The screen is brilliant while it is turned on. It is crisp, bright, and very easy to see from any angle, however, when turned off, every finger print and swipe is suddenly very visible. The brightness overcomes this issue while the device is on.  I have certainly enjoyed using the device and will for the foreseeable future. </content></review>
<review><summary> What's the return policy? </summary><name> AA </name><date> 2010-05-16 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> I am writing this review using the newest ipad64gb 3G that I picked up recently.In brief, this is just an oversized and over expensive  iPhone. The screen is larger but while you can hold the iPhone with one hand and type with your thumb of other hand, iPad is wAy too heavy and too cumbersome for that.The typing is painful, especially if youcantouchtype (notice how last few words didn't have space? It was after my3rd try that I gave up).And that IS the point!If you choose iPAd you choose mediocre device that doesn't fit any real need.You can't watch most of video sites including amazon because mrjobs wouldn't support flash and wouldn't let others do it either). Note that videos on iTunes are more expensive than on amazon.You can't hold device in hand for more than a few minutes.it is too heavy and your wrist will hurt.You can't take it out because screen glare makesit useless.heat shuts it down.YouTube video crashes it and wifi connection drops every few minutes.Finallythe virtual keyboard is a pain and autocorrect makes it worse.My iPad is going back to store. It is not ready and mr.jobs needs to go back to the drawing board.The device may serve old people who don't know how advanced computers are today and would let someone else make all decisions for them. </content></review>

<review><summary> ipad or netbook </summary><name> Bubba </name><date> 2010-05-15 </date><rating> 3 </rating><content> I don't own one but I have played with one in the store and read about it. So if I am wrong about something then forgive me. This is basicaly a big itouch. In my opinion it is great if you want to do some web browsing or read downloaded books on it. Size makes it good to take on a trip so you can browse the internet or watch movies. Wrong! It doesn't have a stand that can pop out so it can be propped up so you can watch a movie. Imagine holding this thing while watching a movie for 90 minutes or laying it flat to type on the onscreen keypad and staring straight down on it. Or you can hold it with one hand and type with the other. You can buy a case that doubles as a stand which makes it bulky and it is not adjustable. You need a case for this because it doesn't have a lid like a netbook. Imagine this big screen unprotected as you carry it around. They hype this up with it's ability to look at photos and watch movies on. Well you have to buy their cables to load pictures or movies into it. There is no ports of any kind or memory card slot. Just their propietary port for their cable. And what good is having your pictures loaded in it if you can't print them or transfer them easily. I would strongly suggest you to take a look at an 11 inch netbook (anything smaller will be a pain to stare at)and weigh out your needs and usefulness of something like this. A netbook can do everything the ipad can and a whole lot more. Can you do your Microsoft word documents, spreadsheets, print, etc. on an ipad? No. You can get a Netbook loaded with features for less and it is a real computer. Add up the costs of adding the optional case/stand, keyboard, business apps, etc. How much is your ipad now. Gripes I have with Apples i devices is that you can't just pop out a dead battery and pop in another one and be on your way. No memory card slot so you can upload or download content. And the kicker is they do this on purpose because they don't want you to have the ability of more memory. Like the iphone, itouch, ipod they will market a device with unbelievable little memory. The following year they will market their newer model with a little more memory and charge you more and so on. What kind of scam is this. So great to use in bed, web surfing, read digital books. Heavy typing or business or school work, no. Netbook little more bulky but can do everything and more. So unless they make a built in stand, put in a usb port, and a memory card slot don't bother. Some argue that it is great for presentations. Yeah but you have do all the work on a computer first and then pull out the cable to load it onto the ipad. You can't make any changes or print anything so now you have to go back to your computer again. I can understand the iphone and itouch with limited potential because they are meant as pocket media devices. But what makes the ipad such a leap forward besides its bigger screen?Everyone is allowed to agree or disagree. I am just trying give some thoughs for people to think about before buying. Some may be fine for what it does, but some might expect more. Ask a lot of questions and verify. </content></review>
<review><summary> The future of mobile computing </summary><name> ctakim </name><date> 2010-05-14 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> Got the iPad after checking it out at Best Buy. Just to be clear it is not an iPhone, it is not a laptop, it is a new device that has instantly been a hit for our family. We use it to check email, watch video, and surf the web. The instant on feature and the large screen make it a fundamentally different device than any product we've used before. The interface just seems so intuitive. We have a MacBook Pro and several iPhones and an iPod touch in our family and but this feels more useful than any of these devices for common tasks as mentioned above. Oh and my wife loves the games, most of which are free on the iTunes App store. Is it perfect, no. It is a bit heavy and don't try to read it outside. But for nighttime reading and viewing the internet, it rocks! Top apps so far are ABC, Netflix, and iBooks/Kindle. I suspect it will only get better as more useful apps are released. </content></review>
<review><summary> iPad 64gb.... Where have you been all my life! </summary><name> Skyarrow </name><date> 2010-05-13 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> When these first came out, I could not decide if I was going to get one. A friend showed me theirs and I was hooked. Have had mine a few weeks now and have to say I love it. But, I love my iPhone, so why wouldn't I. I really see the iPad as a big iPhone. The only thing that I don't like about my iPhone is the size if the screen... well that has now been taken care of. But there is more... I am finding I can use this in meeting and I don't have to take my laptop in. Reading books is great because they are in color, something my wife's Kindle cannot do. I can watch videos to and from work as I ride the bus. For someone that commutes, this is a dream come true.Now there are issues and a new product like this will always have some. I have not had the issue with the wifi problem. It needs a stylus. I want to be able to write notes and this is not going to happen with my finger. Camera would have been nice and when the multitasking comes around this fall, that will be a nice addition. More drive space or a slot for some kind of memory card should have been there, this is a real issue with me, but other than that, I am very happy and really enjoy my iPad. </content></review>

<review><summary> Feels better when you hold it in your hand </summary><name> Adil A. S. Alsuhaim </name><date> 2010-05-10 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> I got a chance to hold and play with the iPad that one of my student brought to me. I am not an apple fanboy, I just evaluate gadgets and buy what works for me. My first impression when it was announced is that it would be nothing but an iPod touch on steroids. After evaluating the iPad and playing with it for an hour, I still have that impression. The iPad has an upgraded processor and memory. It is faster, it has a good battery life. For the one hour I used it, I only lost about 5% of battery. It does not feel awfully big or heavy, but it is not something you carry in your pockets.At $499 for the 16GB/Wifi, there is a great potential offered by the bigger display of the iPad when compared to Touch screen netbook. Please note that 16GB on this iPad are solid state with no moving parts.The only reason why I would buy or recommend such a product is to use it to take notes during classes for students. If you can get a stylus and proper software to take notes, the iPad would really shine at a great value. I would recommend the cheapest iPad if you are on a budget.The screen is clear, and feels nice to browse the web. I reviewed the 64GB/Wifi model and I picked up a decent wireless signal while I was in the university's lab, which was placed in a basement. I heard complaint about signal quality.The virtual keyboard passes with A+. I tried to use it like a normal keyboard and I typed a couple of random sentences with no errors. It sure won't feel like a normal physical keyboard, but I think it is possible to hook wireless keyboard to it (which beats the purpose of getting the iPad)PROS* Virtual keyboard is very usable with minimal mistakes.* There is a great potential of the bigger screen. The possibilities are endless: Drawing, sketching, note taking. I actually I got to impress my student with a quick anime-style drawing.* It is not only a toy. You can use it for education. Children can learn in a fun way, and also adults may use it for note taking. Provided that apps would be available for those purposes.* Battery life is great. I read reviews saying that it even exceeded Apple's expectation.* More apps and things to do than Amazon's kindleCONS* The lack of a camera on the front really cripple the potential of the iPad (and the iPhone, iPod touch as well). You can not make video chat session using an iPad (nor iPhone or iPod Touch). Imagine if you can make Skype calls using the iPad!* Connectivity with other devices requires iPad dock.* I only use this for an hour, but I believe using it for too long will strain one's hand. One could consider using it on a table instead of holding it with one hand.FINAL THOUGHTSI advise people to only buy this if they think they will make a good use of it. Please keep in mind that you are buying a tablet computer. I wouldn't buy it in a heartbeat. I would still keep evaluating its uses that best serve me. </content></review>
<review><summary> Please ignore the skeptics </summary><name> Imagine </name><date> 2010-05-10 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> Do not listen to the people who suggest that this is a large iPod touch.  It does have the potential to be a laptop replacement for the majority of people.  I would say it is a glimpse into the future of laptops.  Laptops have been outselling desktops for awhile now. This should change that.  Ideally I would like a home desktop, iPad and smartphone, with no need of a laptop.  Anyone who reads, this is a must have.  I would even say if i have to do without... i would do with out the smartphone and have a simpler phone. Think about it, i use my iphone more for the apps than its phone by far.  It does surf the web, email, manage photos better than laptops.  Laptops had been desktop replacements, which should change because of this device. Current features that it lacks are complainants from the small minded.  Especially when we know exactly when we would receive the features.  It is a game changer,  with iPhone software worked out for a few years this does not have risks of most early adopter situations. Get use to it. </content></review>

<review><summary> Comparison Between Kindle and Apple iPad </summary><name></name><date> 2010-05-06 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> Want the long and the short of it without having to read a "mega review"? Here goes. I have an original Kindle and a DX and I've had an iPad for one week. I love them all, but the iPad has won me over. Here's what I've experienced so far: VERSATILITY - Apps, movies, music, pictures, effective internet connectivity, color display, extremely intuitive GUI all combine to make iPad the hands down winner in this category. DISPLAY - E Ink is much better for reading, especially in bright light. And, the matte screen on the Kindle doesn't smudge as easily as the iPad screen. However, the iPad has a gorgeous color display and once you get accustomed to it, reading is not difficult. I especially like the backlit display at night when reading in bed ... I can read to my hearts content and not bother my sleeping wife. Slip on the headphones and my full iTunes library is available while I read. If you want a device only to read books, the Kindle wins. If you want color and a display that shows book diagrams and pictures clearly, the iPad wins. PAGE INTERFACE - I actually like turning pages on the Kindle much better than I do on the iPad. While the iPad has a cool page turning visual (it looks like the page is actually turning), the touch screen is far too sensitive and there is very little edge around the screen to hold on to. The result is that I'm constantly turning pages on the iPad when i don't want to. Kindle's buttons win this one hands down. CONVENIENCE - on the iPad, all my media is in one place (audio books, photos, music, books, internet, breaking news/weather, address book, email ... the list goes on.) The Kindle, while and excellent book reading device, still requires me to bring along an iPod or a laptop when I travel. iPad is the clear winner. PRICE - Kindle and the iPad simply aren't that far apart. If a hundred bucks is going to break the budget, stick with the Kindle because it is an excellent reader. If you can afford a little more, go with the iPad... it just is much more versatile. If the Kindle DX were a couple of hundred bucks less, it would be a great reading bargain. AVAILABLE BOOKS - hands down, Amazon slaughters Apple in just sheer volume of available titles. However, Apple's titles often include color pictures, diagrams, etc. that can actually be sized by the reader for easier viewing. Downside here is that Apple's titles are often higher priced. Winner here is Amazon/Kindle. However, there is an App available for the iPad that allows you to read Amazon Kindle media. It is still not a very elegant design, but it does allow you to read these titles easily and I'm sure the App will only improve with time. SEX APPEAL - ok, when the Kindle was first introduced, it was a hot item. I couldn't read it at the airport without being interrupted at least a few times by people asking what it was and waning to look at it. Same thing with the iPad, only it's exponentially hotter. With it's sleek design, excellent color display and tons of Apps, people just go nuts asking questions. In short, it just generates a lot of interest and this is proven by the fact that Apple has already sold over a million of these things during the first month of availability. This thing is addictive ... with the Kindle, I can read a book. With the iPad, I can do almost everything I could before on my laptop AND I can read a book. MY OPINION ONLY - sorry Amazon. You have a great product that pioneered the whole ebook market (others came before you, but you made it work.) Your Kindle is an excellent product, but given the iPad, your device is very much overpriced. Your library continues to be the standard by which all others are judged and I will continue to buy e-books from you, but I'll be reading them on an iPad. On that rare occasion where I'll be laying on a beach reading in direct sunlight, I'll pull out my Kindle because you have an edge there. I hope whoever reads this finds it useful. I the end, it's your money and your preference so my opinion really doesn't matter. I hope you enjoy whichever device you settle on. </content></review>
<review><summary> buy this rather than the WiFi-only model, if only for the GPS </summary><name></name><date> 2010-05-05 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> Life is too full of gadgets, unify where you can. Add an iPad 3G to your life and you can toss the eBook readers, GPS units, and probably an old laptop or two. It's great in the house as an e-mail machine in the kitchen, and it's better in the car, where we might otherwise be arguing about directions. It fits very neatly into basically any portfolio or briefcase.The games aren't bad either.One warning -- these devices are now readily available from Apple for $829 with free shipping. Beware 3rd party sellers on Amazon who are asking much more than that. </content></review>

And I do, up to a point. It is a sleek looking gadget and using the calendar, e-mail and internet over wi-fi - pretty fabulous. The e-reader app, iBook, is really amazing (sorry Kindle, sorry Nook) - the pages turn so quickly, the library shelf interface is very appealing though the e-books are a tad more expensive the BandN e-books.  The apps that work, work well, but the graphics on many apps appear pixelated because they were not designed for the iPad. Maybe it will get better with time. </content></review>

For me, it's fine because I tend to use it late at night or in the morning, and on the weekends when I can sit in my overstuffed easy chair with my favorite microbrew or glass of wine, read my email or browse the web, and feel both decadent and efficient at the same time. :-)Here are the pros and cons:1. Absolutely drop dead gorgeous screen.2. Screen has an oleophobic coating to repel fingerprints, although I've read that wears off over time.3. Very fast switching between apps, minimizing the need for true multitasking.4. Great battery life, up to eight hours, although I haven't ever run it down in a single user session more than to 75%.5. Wifi seems to work just as well as my laptop in terms of range and speed.6. The ability to upgrade to 64 gigs of internal RAM, which I did, although I'm not sure I really needed it.7. Powerful cut and paste feature which I'm still learning how to use correctly. But tapping the screen in various places selects text and graphics in different ways which I haven't totally figured out.8. Even if you don't have iWorks, I found you can cut and past webpages into Notepad. It won't import graphics but you get the text, which is all I need most of the time. The nice thing there is that you can edit the documents at that point, although I doubt I'll be doing much rewriting of anything I grab off the web, but it's useful for making your own notes and comments.9. Standard DVD-R and MPEG-2 videos that I've compressed from about 4 gigs down to about 1 gig MPEG-4 H.264 files to save space look great on my iPAD. You can see some interleaving artifacts of course but they don't look grainy. They still look fine and they take up 1/4 of the space.Here are the cons:1. Although the screen is great, there's about a one inch margin of wasted space around the outside of the screen. Hopefully Apple can eliminate that with newer models.2. Some people may find it heavier than expected. That's because it has two beefy internal batteries which provide the long battery life. But holding it up and trying to read with one hand could prove tiring for some users for any length of time. I usually just prop it in my lap in my easy chair so it's no problem.3. Recharging is a little slow over the USB cable but since the battery life is so long, I haven't found that a problem yet since I can usually use it all day and recharge overnight.4. No true multitasking, but as I said, it's not a serious problem because loading and switching between apps is very fast. Plus the screen size would make having multiple windows open less practical anyway since it's still not as big as a typical laptop, which is fine, because otherwise it would be almost as heavy.5. I bought the Travel Kit Plus case to store and protect the unit. It works just fine, but my only complaint is the price, which is [...] for a case that is basically sort of like one of those padded, zippered book protectors that you can buy which are more like [...]. But the case is certainly fancier than one of those and worth more than 12 bucks. But [...] is a but much.6. A minor point here, but the Travel Kit includes a plastic travel stand, which is a nice feature, but it's too big to fit easily into its zippered pocket. The fit was so tight it was very difficult to get out and you can't get it back in very easily either, and you wouldn't want to for fear of tearing the webbed pocket material. Fortunately you can just store it in the one big pocket.7. Some people have mentioned the lack of a camera, but I don't need or want one so that wasn't an issue with me.All in all a very cool, fun device with only a few shortcomings but with enough power, speed, and utility so that it works fine for me. Other user's experience may vary. Whichever way you decide, good luck with decision! </content></review>
<review><summary> 1 major flaw - no external video for viewing iPad screen or movies... </summary><name> K. Miller </name><date> 2010-05-04 </date><rating> 2 </rating><content> I love it except for one major flaw - you can't view the iPad screen on a larger display.  Even if you buy the vga or composite dongles, the iPad will not support it.  For me, that's simply critical for any business or home use.   It makes it essentially useless with clients and at work.  Overall, I'm guessing it costs me almost 60% of the potential functionality Not to mention it makes it useless with a motel tv when traveling and trying to use a streaming video provider like netflix..  Most video services - in fact most applications - don't work at all - only a very few apple apps. This is embarrassing. My iPad may go back unless Apple can fix this with software pretty darned quickly.We have two 17" macBookPros, iPhones, iPods, airPorts, etc. And this is the first Apple product we didn't love out of the box. </content></review>
<review><summary> An excellent consumption device with some carefully chosen compromises </summary><name> Peter Marreck </name><date> 2010-05-03 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> My after-one-month review:I think this thing will end up being kinda big. It's not perfect (typing at length without a keyboard attached, for example... but at least you can bluetooth a keyboard to it) but there will be a large number of interesting apps and games (there are already a number of eyebrow-raising apps out there such as virtual touchscreen music controllers, board/card game simulators, and streaming media consumption apps). It is in fact not merely a "giant iPod Touch," although to be sure that's some of it. Huge pluses are the interface responsiveness at all times and the long battery life coupled with the size/weight. (Hate it or not, that's what you get when 1 company designs the chip, the OS and all the other hardware.) It does not have a really powerful CPU, though, but you won't notice unless you attempt a heavy data-processing task such as running HTML5 Javascript Canvas demos. 3D games work surprisingly well. When OS 4 comes out, the multitasking will make this even more killer. The games coming out are really cool, for what that's worth.Completely unexpected benefits: 1) For years I was looking for a way to attach a laptop to my treadmill. The iPad fits PERFECTLY on the treadmill shelf. 2) Long car rides with passengers? This could be the ultimate kid pacifier slash map/directions device (with the 3g version). 3) You do in fact start using it more than your laptop, especially for "couchsurfing" and "bedsurfing" (and, uh, "poopsurfing") 4) AirVideo + your movie collection (in any formats) + available anywhere on the internet = amazing.Basically, this fits the bill better for anything that is not serious working or serious gaming.I see a lot of reviews here dinging bad wifi or the lack of this or that feature (sd card reader, camera, etc. etc.) I have not had any wifi problems with my Linksys router. Also, you may want additional features in this device but they would 1) add cost and 2) reduce simplicity, battery life, etc. This is a device of compromises, and I think Apple picked them well even as I know future iPads will probably add more features. If you are looking for SD card readers or USB ports (camera kit notwithstanding) or better data processing then you are really missing a netbook or a full fledged laptop in your life. If there's one feature I wish it had, it would be a camera on the back side to make possible even more amazing "augmented-reality" applications.Lastly, one review talked about an attempted iPad trojan on his setup. I'm sorry, but perhaps it is time to place part of the blame on your attack-vector-infested operating system ::cough:: Windows ::cough:: before you criticize the iPad for trojan attempts. ;) As usual, the situation could probably be improved but Apple stuff still ends up working much better with other Apple stuff. </content></review>
<review><summary> Not more than a gadget. </summary><name> PanPawelPe </name><date> 2010-05-03 </date><rating> 2 </rating><content> iPad doesn't take you beyond more than half a step. Battery is too weak, resolution is too low. Next gen will be something to consider. This is just a bigger iPod. Some do say it can replace Kindle: actually I do not think so. It is something different, but definitely not a suitable ebook reader. To sum up: An iPad? I bought one, tested for a week and then resold. And guess what: I don't miss it at all. </content></review>
<review><summary> Lured Me Away from my Netbook! </summary><name> James Vandernaald </name><date> 2010-05-03 </date><rating> 2 </rating><content> The Apple iPod. A marvelous device! What I like about it is the ease of navigating among and within applications with a touch of the fingers. (No stressful laptop touch pads.) Checking email (with a $99/year mobileme subscription) could not be more user friendly. Watching streaming Netflix movies or listening to iTunes using Bluetooth wireless headphones is superb. Reading the New York Times or Time Magazine or eBooks is ideal. And, managing fingerprints with a bottle of Windex close at hand could not be more enjoyable.My well thought-out plan was to pre-order an iPad Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 3G, 64G, and then after I received and got used to it, to offer my Netbook for sale on Ebay to help finance the iPad. But, as I used the iPad over 24 hours, and as time ticked by, I looked longingly at my old and loyal friend the Netbook. So many things I could do with the Netbook, that I could not do with the iPad.  No multitasking, no USB port, and no more of the Windows and Mac applications that I had come to rely on. I started feeling depressed about it, particularly when I realized that the screen size on my iPad was about the same as my Netbook (and no need for Windex). In fact, I came to the astonishing conclusion that there was nothing I could do with the iPad that I could not do with my Netbook.So, I changed my plans, sold the iPad on eBay (within 1 hour) for what I paid for it, and returned to my Netbook with new love and respect.Neither the Netbook nor the iPad is an alternative to a full size desktop PC, but for traveling, I discovered that the iPad is not an alternative to either one. Disclaimer:  I am in no way employed or have any financial interest in any company manufacturing or distributing Netbooks.  I got caught up in the iPad hype but have returned home. ps: In addition to my Windows 7 Netbook, I am a loyal iMac-24 user (but with Windows XP in the Bootcamp partition when I need it). </content></review>
<review><summary> WiFi unreliable / Good luck returning! </summary><name> J. Metro </name><date> 2010-05-02 </date><rating> 2 </rating><content> We bought 2 Ipads for our business to demo some applications to customers. At first the WiFi connection worked well and the demos went amazingly well. But the Ipad's internet connection failed frequently making it unreliable. We tested in parallel with a MacBook which had no problems syncing to the wireless network at the same same the ipad failed. We tried this on 5 different WiFi networks and each had the same issues. We tried to return them to the Apple Store in San Francisco and they insisted there was no problem with them based upon their brief test and they said they never heard of this problem before (it has been documented all over the web including MacWorld). It took an hour of running it up Apple's chain before they finally agreed to a refund. I hope they can get this WiFi issue resolved - then it would be a good product. But until we know it is set, we will not buy any more of these. </content></review>
<review><summary> a toy from.... </summary><name> Alex Ferdman </name><date> 2010-05-02 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> Yes, it actually works if you willing to waste your time. Very unfriendly tablet. No paperwork. As I compare this tablet to regular PC this tablet worth exactly  10 bucks. The only valuable future is Internet access. Its not really fast either. Other strange thing is everybody told me Apple protected against viruses--nonsense. In first 10 minutes some program attacked tablet and luckily for me I was fast enough to shut tablet down. If I have question and I do I have to drive to Apple store and ask.Avoid. </content></review>
<review><summary> COULD BE BETTER </summary><name> Margaux Paschke </name><date> 2010-04-30 </date><rating> 3 </rating><content> This tablet did not live up to all the hype for me to be completely happy.  I went to the Apple store and this was the only one near my price range.  I loved all the apps Apple provides but the 16 GB limit, work document limitations and the steep price forced me to return it.  This is not to say that I wouldn't be back for the next generation because I will, hoping that the price comes down and the features are improved.  I loved the book reading option (comes in handy for trips) and viewed movies looked  great.  I did not find the screen too glossy for viewing as noted by some but then I added a protective skin to the screen.  Playing games on this device was fun for this novice.  The ipad does not allow for multitasking so listening to music on this device is not really an option I would use.  The iwork application needs lots of improvement, it was slow and did not always work for me.  The battery life was good, it allowed for weekend use (a little more then 7 hours?) before having to recharge.  It was easy to use but I had a hard time connecting it to my printer.  The ipad is slim and lightweight, easy to carry around but invest in a protective sleeve.  It was slower then I'd like to adjust after turning on its side (comparing it to my ipod) but that's getting picky.         I think this tablet is a great media device but touting it as an all-in-one is over reaching.  I have yet to find the gadget that has the perfect blend of media, portability (with healthy battery life) and document functions.  I am looking into the Gigabyte M912x Notebook Umpc 160g 8.9" Touchnote Mr or the Lenovo S10-3t 0651-37U 10.1-Inch Multitouch Netbook (Black).  They're around the same price point and have  touchscreens that swivels to fold into a tablet and then fold back into a netbook for protection. You buy an Apple product for the cool apps and this device is no different.  I love the concept of the gadget but need it to perform more work to justify the purchase to myself.  I do not need another media device.  I have my fingers crossed that the 2nd generation will be better. </content></review>
<review><summary> Price tag too high for what it does. </summary><name> Michael Jude Kelsey </name><date> 2010-04-30 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> The title says it all.  The price tag of the iPad is way to high for what it is capable of.  As others have stated before me:-screen is glossy (very hard to read outside; unlike the kindle)-storage capacity is low-wifi connectivity issues that apple refuses to admit too-and you don't see the features on it that you expect for paying upwards of $600.-issues with connecting to other products, i.e. printers, wifi storage devices, but then again.. it's a Mac product, what do you expect?For $600 you can buy a netbook and a kindle and have WAY more capability. </content></review>
<review><summary> lacking in several places </summary><name> torquemada </name><date> 2010-04-30 </date><rating> 2 </rating><content> ok let's see, the iphone already does 90% of the tasks featured here. you can play a game, read a book, browse the internet, play mp3's and look at pictures. only here it's just bigger. minus the phone. and it doesnt even have a USB port or flash support (or wireless sync). and it's not a computer either . for this price why not buy a netbook? at least a net book has the ipad's features and more (even if you wont be able to 'enjoy' clicking on glass instead of a keyboard): it's actually a full computer. if you favor attitude over functionality, the ipad is your next best gadget to buy. it's thin, shiny and attractive.it's somewhere between the iphone and a netbook but misses crucial functions the iphones and netbooks (and laptops, in short) already have for a smaller pricetag. everybody wants the ipad. but do people actually need an oversized, overpriced and brainless browsing board?now if Apple manages to put a cpu into this, i'll be the first to buy one, as i work in heavy graphics (and carrying an electronic drawing pad/computer is also a great ecological alternative to paper), but for now, the ipad's functions havent convinced me to set myself back 600-800$. </content></review>
<review><summary> WiFi Sucks, Do Not Buy until Apple fixes </summary><name> J. Batchelor </name><date> 2010-04-29 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> OK, I've had my iPad for almost a month.  I continue to suffer repeated WiFi problems.  It's not my router, it works fine with my iMac and my iPod.  It's time for Apple to admit there is a problem and get a software fix for this thing.  It becomes useless to you since you won't be able to maintain a connection with the internet.WAIT TO BUY THIS UNTIL APPLE ADMITS AND FIXES THE PROBLEM!!!Other than that, it is very nice, but it really needs to work. </content></review>

<review><summary> iPad - great tablet with annoying flaws in its major tasks </summary><name> Axemal </name><date> 2010-04-28 </date><rating> 3 </rating><content> I have been using iPad for 10 days and decided to walk away. It is a nice tablet device that I primarily was planning to use as:  - ebook reader while using public transportation  - showing movies to kids during vacation trips  - using as picture hub on vacations to store/review/sort photos  - browser (one that I can use on the sofa)  - generic computer for vacations and travel (way lighter than notebook)  - viewing and occasionally answering email at home when primary iMac is occupied.Usually Apple devices are aesthetically pleasant to work with. iPad is not an exception, unless you are outside. The device is great for reading at home in controlled light (though a bit harder on the eyes comparing to e-ink readers), but outside (on a train/bus) it has serios glare and reflections on the screen even without direct sunlight. It felt annoying. I guess after months of use one gets used to it, but in a few days I haven't started enjoying reading with it. I wonder if matte screen would have done better. As far as watching movies, its mono speaker lacks power. I guess I'm not a typical user here as I got two kids, so headphones aren't an option. Getting its speakers up to the iMac level would be excellent. I realize that it's hard to fit on a way smaller device, but a little bit better speakers would actually let two persons watch movie together. Again, glare and reflection of yourself on dark scenes are guaranteed in pretty much every lighting condition. Some people don't bother about it; some people do, so see for yourself.Having SD port would be great to transfer photos from my camera. I don't really want to mess with extra cords here. Overall, it's been a pity to see device coming short of expectations.  I'll wait for 2nd version, and would love to see better screen, better speakers and SD port there. And a camera would let me Skype. I don't care much about flash or multi-tasking. Apple, please, do something about the glare/reflections. These "great" glossy screens aren't that great for some of us, I do have mirror at home already. That stands for both iPad and iMac. Old white iMacs had way better matte screens than current glossy ones. Having matte as an option would be excellent. </content></review>
<review><summary> Straight beast. </summary><name> Steven Bonner </name><date> 2010-04-28 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> This thing is amazing. It really feels futuristic. The touch is amazing. The games are great, my main reason for the unit. Touchgrind HD and Asphalt 5 HD are amazing! You got to get one of these... You'll be the talk of the town. </content></review>
<review><summary> Not perfect, but highly enjoyable! </summary><name> H. Grove </name><date> 2010-04-27 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> First off: no, it isn't a portable computer replacement. If you expect it to be, you'll only be disappointed. Nor is it just an oversized PDA despite claims to the contrary. Instead, it's a robust adjunct to your main computer. It allows me to take most of my web browsing, game playing, email reading, etc. away from my desk. In large part, whether the iPad suits your needs will depend on whether you can find apps for it that suit your needs. So far there's a wide array of apps, so I haven't found this to be much of a problem--but again, it'll depend on your needs.It's true that there are some things you just can't do on an iPad, like view Flash content on websites. I do find this occasionally annoying, but honestly, I just hope it convinces more websites to stop using so much Flash content. I've always found that it bogs down my machine and causes more problems than it fixes. In contrast, I've found that the apps on my iPad load and run super-fast. They're streamlined to have a small footprint, and it shows. They load so fast that load screen tips in games often flash past before I can read them. They also take up a surprisingly small amount of memory; I'm amazed at how slowly I'm using up my 16G!The on-screen keyboard is actually pretty good, and suits normal finger size much better than that on the tinier iPhone screen, but it still isn't meant for extended typing. I'm also addicted to the touch-screen interface. It feels so natural that I find myself trying to use my laptop as though it had one.Since I do a lot of reading and reviewing, and I absolutely hate the other e-readers I've played with (the screen flash when turning pages would drive me batty before I finished a single book), the iPad's value as an e-reader was important to me. In this, it truly shines. You can download the Barnes and Noble reader and the Kindle reader for free. GoodReader makes a fantastic pdf reader (just import pdfs from the app tab when synching with your computer). iBooks, however, blew me away. As a book geek, I really like the experience of reading a book rather than a computer file. And iBooks looks the most like a book.I'm truly amazed by the screen quality, the speed of everything, the variety of apps available, and the utility of the iPad as an e-reader. I can use it near-constantly for heavy-use things like gameplay and the charge lasts me a good 24 hours. </content></review>

<review><summary> Good gadget but limited use and practicality in real life - more a giant iPod/MP3 than a computer </summary><name> SA </name><date> 2010-04-25 </date><rating> 2 </rating><content> Many reviews have said it (reviews by Apple fanboys and worshippers should be taken with a pinch of salt).- Good 'instant-on' device for short quick activities like email; but don't expect to type anything longer than a tweet or text message; painfully slow and impractical. As a typer, I tend to rest my fingers on the keyboard - but that is BAD for a touchscreen. For longer emails or typing, I almost always find myself switching to my laptop.- Very good looks and sleek; good battery life (I go up to 8-10 hours on a single charge)- The browser doesn't works with more than half of the websites that I normally browse.- I get neck pain/strain after a while trying to type and read on the same 'plane' (un-natural posture)- It is NOT a laptop replacement (let alone a killer); it needs a laptop as the 'mothership' for initial setup, software updates, etc. Actually, it uses the same OS as the iPhone/iPod and is identical to an iPod with a bigger screen.- I always find myself using my iPhone than iPad; iPad is too big to carry in a pocket and too small to be practical and useful like a laptop.- Can't print anything from it; - I could have thrown away my paper notepad if iPad had handwriting recognition (or sketch) to take quick notes.- The glossy screen is practially useless (unless used in a dark room at night); outdoors it is horrendous to read anything easily. Kindle/Nook are the BEST choices for read anything meaningfully 'longer' in content (books, papers, etc).Net: Still trying to figure out how, where and when I can really use the iPad. I certainly don't want to carry too many gadgets: e-book reader, phone, laptop and a giant-screen MP3 player:-)May 1st update: WiFi on iPad is horrendous. Can't connect and keeps dropping connections when other windows laptops or smart phones connect and hold. </content></review>
<review><summary> Wait 3G Version, Not Worth The Money, WiFi didn't work </summary><name> malexandria </name><date> 2010-04-25 </date><rating> 2 </rating><content> The iPad is full of the promise for the future and when you buy it, that's what you are banking on - that things will be awesome in the future. I purchased the 64-Gig Wi-Fi version on day one and immediately had problems with it. I arrived at my hotel from my business meeting at about 5pm and wanted to play with my new toy. It took 3hrs to sync my 50 Gig iTunes Library because it kept crashing, it was nightmare because it kept finding "corrupted" files during the sync process and crashing - these are files I purchased in iTunes and had to DELETE before the sync would work and to make matters worse I can't re-download those files, so if I want another Digital copy of Terminator - that work, I would have to buy it (even though it had always synched fine before). It's why I loathe DRM. The hotel that I was in only used a hard wired connection, so I had to go down to the lobby to use the WiFi and set up all my apps which wasn't cool. Due to the lack of multi-tasking it took almost two hours to set up my apps like the Kindle, Marvel, etc. Because I could only download one book at a time and I had to sit there and watch the download progress bar. It was almost 11pm by the time I finally got everything setup.  At the Airport, I didn't want to pay $10 for two hours of WiFi (another reason I hate WiFi only devices, most places charge too much money for it and it rarely works well), so I tried to watch a couple of movies and the screen completely washed out in the "bright" light. I couldn't see any movies that were "dark" like Harry Potter, Xfiles, etc.  After one day of minimal use this thing had Smudges all over the place, it looked ugly when turned off. Luckily the smudges don't really show when it's turned on.The real trouble started when I got home. The thing refused to stay connected to my Verizon Fios network. Every time it woke from sleep not only did I have to reconnect but I had to re-enter my Network ID, reading web sites became an exercise in frustration because it disconnected literally every 2 or 3 minutes. And a lot of Apps simply "crashed" the second the connection was lost. So it failed miserably at it's most basic function. I found it to be too big, heavy and uncomfortable to actually read in Bed, I actually had to lay it down in landscape mode with a little prop stand provided by the iPad case to read it. If I had to do that, I'd might as well use a laptop. I'm assuming I would have gotten used to holding if I had more time to play with it, but I only had an unreasonable 14 days to return it.When Apps work, they were beautiful to look at and use - Plants Vs. Zombies, Marvel, Comixology, ABC, Yahoo (surprisingly amazing free app), Kindle, Zinio, etc. The Apps is why you get this. The problem is a lot of these apps are way too much where they are .99 or 2.99 on the iPhone, they are inflated to $10 and up on the iPad. The price inflation is ridiculous, especially considering most of these apps won't work on your iPhone. I'd be willing to pay $7 or $8 if they worked on both.For a device that's $900 (it's only worth purchasing the 3G 64 Gig Model - you will fill up the 16 and 32 gigs quickly when the apps are averaging almost a gig), it's damn difficult to actually get my files onto the device. I have a bunch of Comic book .jpgs, word docs, etc. that I would like use, but have yet to figure out how to actually get them on the device. I broke down and bought the Pages App because that was supposed to make it easy, but it did nothing to help me get my files over. So that was a waste of money. Apple just screwed over iPad users by delaying the release of the SDK 4.0 that brings multi-tasking until this fall.So yes, I returned the WiFi version, I'm tempted to get the 3G version but $900 is just too much for a device that's only based on potential, and not what it actually is today. It also kills me that I kind of miss having it and I would be rewarding Apple for making the WiFi version so Gimpy that I'm forced to purchase the 3G when I already know how bad ATandT's 3G is. </content></review>
<review><summary> IPad: Not for real users, more like a toy for gadgets fans </summary><name> Eduardo Godyla </name><date> 2010-04-25 </date><rating> 3 </rating><content> Hi,I am technical director at a software company. It has been a long time ago since I did my last programming, and nowadays I am doing mostly Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, Powerpoint presentations and Pdf document reading. Why all MS Office an Pdf ? Because 100% of our customers and suppliers use it.I like the iPad because I am truly a gadget fan, and I wanted to study its application to real business.My conclusion is that the software which is available for the iPad is still not mature, even tough the concept derives from the ipod/iphone, which have been around for a while now.From a hardware point of view, the device is quasi-perfect. Performance is great, size is OK (albeit I would prefer 16:9) and technological concepts behind the interface are very good. But again, almost everything is inherited from the ipod touch and the iphone. So from the hardware point of view, it is nothing revolutionary. An USB port would be a real plus.From the software point of view, there is much that needs to be worked out:The Numbers appliction, doesn't save files in Excel format, doesn't let fou open/save spredsheets from "internet disks" (WebDav Servers), with the exception of [...], which is really used for sharing documents and doesn't allow editing. So for working with Excel spreadsheets and sharing information for editing on the move with your co-workers, the Numbers application is useless.The Keynote app has exactly the same problem. No saving in Powerpoint format and no way of sharing the files for editing with your co-workers.The Pages app better, since it can save in Word format, but still no access to "internet disks".There are other offerings for MS Office compatible Suites, but I have evaluated 2 of them and both have big problems saving the spreadsheets, loosing the format and formulas when doing so. Result: Useless with the spreadsheets I use daily.The Mail Application is good enough, even tough you cannot send multi file attachments, so you will have to send the attachments one by one.The Browser will not render flash content. Until HTML5 becomes a widespread standard, this is also a minus, since flash is sometimes required for my business research.And as the last issue, there is not real printing support. Sure, there are some apps out there, but most of them uses "tricks" to print entire documents (like using a master pc for example: not really mobile).The iBooks application works very well if you are capable of converting pdf docs to the iPad format. Now I can read 500 pages technical specs on my couch instead od sitting endless hours sitting in front of my laptop (alltough I could use my laptop on the couch, believe me it is not really confortable).So my perception is that it will take some time until the available software matures enough, so that the device is ready for use in real business.As a home use gadget, it is a very interesting and promising device. But be aware: It is an ipod with a larger screen, which has it's advantages, since it can be used for tasks for which the ipod was not well suited to.As the time goes by, I will do more tests and post my findings. </content></review>
<review><summary> Actually prefer an iPod Touch </summary><name> Matt S. </name><date> 2010-04-25 </date><rating> 2 </rating><content> It took me 30 minutes to get tired of the iPad. Having owned an iPod Touch for 2 years (until it was stolen last fall), the iPad felt routine and commonplace. The bigger screen is the only major difference, and I found it to be a negative one (but I recommend you try one out for yourself at your local Apple store):1. The iBook app text was too spacious. Studies show that we prefer to read narrow, 5-6 word columns so that we have minimal use of eye muscles. The iPod Touch is closer to this; The screen is only a few inches across, so there is automatically minimal eye movement for a streamlined reading experience. The iPad however, I could tell quickly would be much more tedious on the eyes than even a regular book. When the iBook is in the 2 pages orientation, not even one paragraph will fit the whole screen (on the smallest font). Your eyes and brain will be tracking greater distances for less information. 2. Safari web browsing has additional issues on top of spacious text.  - The iPad has about an inch-wide border between the edge touching your hand and the scrollable screen. So when scrolling, your thumb has to reach across a bit, adding a little awkwardness that may get tiring, and I found immediately annoying. Also, since the thumb is extended out, it will tend to be swiped up and left, which pulls the text you're reading out of alignment, and will need to be further adjusted. With the iPod Touch, the screen is a few millimeters from the edge, so scrolling is easily accessible, and the thumb is swiped completely vertical, keeping the text inline. Try it right now and see for yourself the difference of your thumb's movement when extended vs. not. - Depending on how zoomed in you are on the larger screen, you may also have to be more dramatic with your gestures, moving your hand across the whole screen if you want to scroll down a website. In fact, in general the ipad requires more muscle, if not to span across the screen as you interact, then just in holding the heavier device. The ipod Touch is much more leisurely in this regard. - Both devices have the double-tap feature that will automatically zoom a frame of a website to fit the screen, however doing this on the iPad gives you large, spacious text that spans the whole screen and is more difficult to read. This can be fixed with manual zoom, but thats one hassle I don't get with the ipod Touch. Lastly, the iPad's size makes it non-pocketable. Part of the iPod Touch's charm is that it is always in your pocket available to your fingertips and curious brain. Can't say that about this awkwardly-sized device, however.After I submit this, I'm going to purchase the 3rd gen, 8GB Touch for 180 bucks and get a better experience than I would with the iPad. I say check it out for yourself though (including a ipod Touch if you haven't yet), but keep these things in mind, because they are issues that I think usually only get noticed after the honeymoon is over. </content></review>
<review><summary> Not Impressed </summary><name> Thomas A. Jackson </name><date> 2010-04-25 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> Like all other Apple products, I have never been impressed with them and their price schemes are too high.  Never been one of those that believe in "techno-hype".  I stick with what works and what provides the most support and what will be around.  Despite my dislike for Microsoft, I love the stability of the operating environment and the familiarity of its technology. </content></review>
<review><summary> Not just hype... </summary><name> John Lundell </name><date> 2010-04-24 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> I for one was excited when the announcement came out about the iPad. Unlike friends and colleagues, I looked past the funny name and lack of camera and saw something big coming. Once I had the device in my hand I knew it was a winner - could anyone doubt Apple? Sure there are some missing pieces, but this is the beginning of something really great. I can't remember the last time I was enthused about technology. Now I'm addicted. I carry my iPad back and forth to work, to meetings, and I'm prone to checking the iTunes store for new apps every few hours. Its like Christmas almost every day. There are so many wonderful apps already out, more on the way, and those that are out now are improving with updates constantly. I don't think the iPad (or similar copy-cat devices) will be for everyone... I'm sad for those who don't see the potential or will never find a good use for something like this. Love or hate Apple, this is honestly the game changer it was billed as - it will change your life for the better. Its not a large iPod, its not a netbook, its not a laptop replacement.. or is it all of these things. Thats for you to decide. Once you try it you will know, and the uses will grow every day. I didn't see the iPhone coming, but this one was obvious. Just watch out because your life will change. </content></review>

<review><summary> Needs Flash support </summary><name> John Keck </name><date> 2010-04-24 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> There is so much to like about this product. It is versatile, light, and adds to my productivity and entertainment. What cripples it as a Web browser is lack of support for Flash. Whether Apple likes it or not, Flash is so ubiquitous that the iPad fails to live up to Apple's claim regarding it's abilities as a Web browser. </content></review>
<review><summary> It's all about the Apps and the Speed </summary><name> D. Goodheart </name><date> 2010-04-24 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> As with many Apple products, the form factor of the iPad is amazing and what is does, it does incredibly well. There are other products that do similar things but not the way the iPad does. It is a beautiful and amazing media machine, and it will only get better over time.  It may become a constant companion.  Thankfully it is relatively light!What really separates the iPad from other computing devices is the App store.  The incredible selection of applications and the ease of downloading them is unmatched.  IPhone users already know the wonders of the App store, but the iPad takes it to another level.  The Pages word processor or the Keynote presentation program for $9.99 each?  Games and productivity apps for free or for a couple of dollars?  Unique piano simulators for free or next to nothing?   NY Times or USA Today for free?  Netflix at the tips of your fingers?  UTube fast and easy?  Obviously I could go on and on, but visiting the App Store is like being a kid in a candy store.  So much and so cheap.  And you know the number of apps will continue to grow.  Apple's tight control over the apps had a good and bad side: the good being the quality of the apps, the bad being someone else deciding what can't be sold for the iPad.  In this case, the good outweighs the bad.I read an article saying that you had to lie to yourself about what you were going to use the iPad for to justify its purchase.  No lead to lie, just find it at the app store!  If it isn't there yet, it probably will be.  What are the killer apps?  Time will tell.  But more than anything it is the incredible combination of inexpensive applications available that makes the iPad unique.Sure people have had a field day over what they consider to be the shortcomings of this device.  Personally I feel they have blown them out of proportion.  The lack of flash is a temporary problem since many sites are moving to html5.  Can't say that I would mourn the demise of flash.  It has created as many problems as it has solved.  Sure a camera would be a nice addition, and it will probably arrive in the next generation.  Multitasking is definitely coming in a few months.  The iPad will have a bigger impact than even most of its optimistic supporters realize.  And the reason is simple.  It's all about the Apps.UPDATE MAY 14, 2010:From several weeks of use, I stand by what I said about the apps.  Things I have noticed that I did not mention above:Pros:   -- Instant on.  No waiting for a computer to go through all the start up process to start using it.  It makes me want to reach for it and turn it on more often than a laptop or desktop.  It's right there when you need it! -- Speed.  Surfing the web is incredibly smooth and fast.  There are a few web sites where I have noticed the lack of flash support, but for the most part surfing the web has become a real pleasure. -- Games.  Amazing.  Even solitaire is fun again.  But games like Labyrinth 2 HD and Sparkles HD really bring out the best graphics and features of the IPad.  I own practically every dedicated video game machine made, and this beats them all for puzzle and arcade games. -- Newspapers and magazines.  Instead of the morning paper, I now enjoy my morning IPad.  Reading the latest news on this machine is a new and exciting experience.  Once you have done it, you don't want to go back to plain old paper. -- The mail client is so easy to set up and to use.  Well designed and a real complement to a desktop system. -- I continue to be amazed by the brightness and clarity of the screen.  A definite wow factor even after weeks of use.Cons: -- Lack of a true file system.  There's no finder to sort through and find your files.  Even though there is an app for reading pdf files, it should be a lot easier.  The only way to find files is to open the app associated with them. -- The instant gratification of the App Store can be addictive.  Even though I've downloaded a lot of free apps, I have gone through a good chunk of change on paid apps, thinking "Oh, it's only $4.99 or $9.99."  Believe me, they add up! -- All right, I give in on the lack of multitasking.  Should have been there from the beginning.  Although the instantaneous switching between apps almost makes up for it, along with the multi-page display of web pages in Safari.  I wish there was at least a "go back to your previous app" button. -- Yes, the constant wiping off finger prints from the screen.  No way around it. -- The tiny buttons on some web pages are hard to hit exactly with your finger.  Takes practice and a good aim! </content></review>
<review><summary> Awesome device </summary><name> Kalidas Radhakrishnan </name><date> 2010-04-23 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> Like many people here and everywhere, I was absolutely apprehensive about the iPad(or the giant iPod Touch as iPad haters like to call it). But after spending a few days with this device, I can tell you for sure that this is the way a large screen touch input based device should have been done.The Things that i love about the iPad1) The Keyboard is just awesome . Very easy to type even when using one hand. 2) iBooks - Simply fantastic , Hopefully, the catalog will expand massively. I prefer this to the kindle when I am indoors because everything in an iBook is in colour.  3) iWorks - Fantastic even though you cannot export to Powerpoint or Excel formats. Only Word is supported. Even the lack of "Track Changes" option did not  bother me much. 4) Good Battery life5) The ability to import Photos on the go.6) Availability of Netflix App 7) You can actually do things efficiently using just an iPad and a internet source.  8) Safari for the iPad is a very efficient browser. Obviously, it does not support flash, but then that is price adobe paid for some crime they committed some time back.9) Most of the apps that work on an iTouch/iPhone works on the iPad.10) Does not heat up much after heavy usage.Things that are not available in the iPad when they should have been1) Finder for the iPad 2) Network Explorer( so you can drag and drop docs from your other laptops/desktops into your ipad without using iTunes) - I have tonnes of pdf articles/books and other docs in my home server and would have loved to have this functionality)3) Print functionality ( Though this depends on HP , Canon and their ilk)4) bluetooth mouse connectivity5) ability to transfer data (music/files) using the camera connector kit accessory) from a USB drive or SD card drive.6) A Nice Photo Editor( Apple developed). 7) I really did not feel the absence of multi tasking, but then I can appreciate controlled multitasking wherein I have control over what apps are allowed to run in the background.Things that are annoying1) iPad is smudge heaven - you dont notice those smudges when it is on, but the moment you press the sleep button/lock screen button , you can see hundreds of smudges. 2) The screen is too glossy - I presonally prefer Matte, but we dont have that option anymore. 3) Reading in broad daylight when the sun is right over your head is annoying4) Absence of a Finder/Windows Explorer kinda application Overall, I feel that there is no show stopper here and that the iPad is actually a good device for the average male/female and for anyone who is not into anything too technical.P.S , I have a verizon mifi and my iPad tethers to the mifi device. I have not experienced any network related issues so far. It seems sturdy and reliable. </content></review>

<review><summary> It's a satisfying device, with a few minor drawbacks </summary><name> L. Vang </name><date> 2010-04-22 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> Guess I'm not the only PC-loving fan that bought the iPad.  Like others, I've also never owned a single Apple product.Before the iPad came out, I was in the market for a portable laptop (not netbooks).  In fact, I bought a 14" Win7 laptop with a blu-ray drive and hdmi output.  It was a great laptop.  However, within a week...it was taking longer and longer to boot-up.  In addition, when I bought it...it was advertised at 4.5 hour battery life.  When I used it, even after fixing all the settings, I was only getting 3 hours at most.  To me, it was too much of a disappointment so I returned it.Later, someone told me that a macbook has 7+ hours, so I figured it was worth checking out.  However, when I got to the store...I ended up getting the iPad.  Why, you might ask?  Well...here's what I was looking for:1.) Long battery life2.) Portable and light-weight3.) Fast boot-up time4.) Can connect to the internet via wi-fi G+N5.) Can play music and moviesYes, the Macbook can do all that...but being so used to the PC interface, I didn't like the Mac interface.  The iPad was completely different all together and everything was very intuitive.  So far, the iPad hasn't disappointed me in any of those categories.  I love being able to turn it on and connect to the internet within a minute.  I love not having to charge it after watching 1 movie.  I love how light it is.  I love how fast it responds.  I love it's small footprint.  I love how highly-customizable it is.  There's a lot of things I love.However, there are a few things that I didn't love (though not enough to make me want to return it).  1.) It does not play flash -- meaning it cannot play hulu, cwtv, or even the subtitles on youtube. I knew it didn't play flash, but I didn't realize how many sites actually used flash to play their video content.2.) the max size it comes with is 64 gb, with no way to expand using a microSD, etc.  This is barely enough if you have a lot of movies.3.) The external speakers sound terrible, though I'm thankful they even came with some. 4.) Glare is terrible, especially when there is a light right behind you.  I know most monitor these days uses a glossy, vibrant display...but my old laptop didn't so I wasn't expecting so much glare.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and would easily recommend it to others.  It's a great device for checking e-mails, facebook, news, blogs, etc. and for watching movies.  ITunes is fairly easy to use too, much better than Windows Media Player for syncing devices.  Btw, the iPad does feel durable so I didn't feel the need to get a case and screen protector.  At most, maybe I will get a case so it's not so slippery to hold.Also, don't get the iPad dock.  Instead, get any normal book holder.  It does the job fine. </content></review>
<review><summary> Unlike the Trolls, I really did buy an iPad </summary><name> ASG </name><date> 2010-04-22 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> Great device. Does exactly as advertised and more.What I love:1. VideoNetflix, ABC, iTune transfered movies, and an amazing app called AirVideo that allows me to play video from my iMac or PC directly on my iPad without transferring it to my iPad.Stunning smooth video, no complaints.2. emailI've got 7 email accounts on this thing and it functions flawlessly.3. Internet browsingI'm very happy with the browser, especially the speed and finger gestures. It's intuitive and fast.4. Work appsI'm an IT admin and this thing is a great tool for admins like me.VPN is built in.VNC and RDP function nicely for remote access to my work environment.Dropbox keeps my files synced.And a little app called TeamViewer lets me fix my family members computers remotely.5. Planning and keeping track of my daily activities is easier with the multitude of To-Do apps, calendar, and Notes Pro app.  Everything is in one place.6. Kindle/iBooks are great. Super convenient in a way that's got me reading books again.7. KAYAK Flights is a fantastic app to check flight pricing whenever I want.8. Keeping up with the latest news on USA Today, SCI FI Wire, TUAW, DVICE, Ingadget, as well as Twitter, Woot, eBay, Newegg, and Craigslist couldn't be more convenient.9. Blogging, Cooking, weather, games, music on Pandora, movie times, tv guides, Yellow and White pages, writing pad (handwriting recognition), millage tracker, etc are just a few of the "useless" apps people complain about and I use every day.As far as the iPad shortcomings, we all knew what they were before it came out.  So why buy it if it's not what you want?I'm good with no camera.  I've got a camera on my iMac and video calls are uncomfortable and unnecessary.  Why would I want it on my iPad?People complaining about the lack of high-def video-out kill me.  It's a portable device, not a 50 inch plasma screen!  Use it for what it's intended for and get over it.Lack of Flash can be annoying, but that shortcoming wasn't a deal breaker for me.  I don't miss it.I own a netbook. It's been sitting on my desk for months, unused. Video stutters, internet is difficult to use, audio is terrible, battery life is weak.  And that's after upgrading to 2gb of memory.In other word, it's not better than my iPad and I'm selling it.The biggest plus of my iPad is convenience.  It's always on and ready.  I rarely use my computers anymore.So, if you do some due diligence and actually find out what an iPad does, you should be able to make an educated decision on whether it's for you or not.I don't believe a windows based tablet can come close to functioning as nicely as an iPad. An Android tablet might.I don't think I'm the only one happy with these, close to 1 million have been sold.  And that's before the 3G models have hit the shelves or sales outside the US have started.Ya, Steve Jobs really messed up with the iPad.  Guess the stock holders should get rid of him before Apple stock hits 300 and makes them more money than they can count... </content></review>
<review><summary> THESE REVIEWS ARE NOT ACCURATE - APPLE HATERS ARE REALLY OUT TO KILL THIS SWEET APPLE PRODUCT! </summary><name> Sammy Carr </name><date> 2010-04-22 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> 5/1/10 - APPLE HATERS ARE REALLY OUT IN FULL FORCE ON THE IPAD....TRY THIS PRODUCT AT AN APPLE STORE OR BEST BUY ......I have had my iPad for 2 weeks and it is totally wonderful. The LED backlit screen is the sharpest and most accurate I have ever seen! The device is light, easy to move around, extremely fast and does browsing, books, music, photo's, email, and loads of other things perfectly and so so clearly. The iPad also has a characteristic regarding ease of use that no laptop or desktop or net-book has ever had. It feels like you are totally in charge-no mouse to learn, no keyboard to click, all one seamless piece of glass that works flawlessly and faultlessly. Wi-fi is wonderful and works all over the house and outside near the house. The screen is so bright that even in daylight sunshine, you can work and watch this baby. And my first charge watching 3 movies and loads of other things gave me 12 hours of battery. You actually forget that it has a battery! This is another game changer devise and I fully recommend it to anyone who wants a computer thats powerful yet the simplest one I have ever used or in my opinion ever built! This is one strong solid tablet and it will do the job! 100% recommended!!! </content></review>

<review><summary> Good Product, No Buyer's Remorse </summary><name> B. Stogsdill </name><date> 2010-04-21 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> For a very long time I have played with portable devices, trying to get one that met my needs. I tried the Pocket PC, Palm Pilot, cellphones, and nothing quite satisfied my needs. In general, I wanted a light weight, easy to carry device that would enable me to search the web and read pdf/word/powerpoint/ and  excel documents. I was also looking for something to store my address book and a calender for scheduling and to do list. Despite popular belief, the ipad is in no way a tablet PC. As a matter of fact, it is basically an ipod touch with a larger screen and slightly more powerful processor. Understanding that, you can decide whether this is really the device you wanted. In my case, it absolutely was. I have no ipod touch, so I did not have that feeling of repetition when purchasing this item. I have enjoyed the ipad, and while I initially felt some pangs of buyer's remorse, the longer I have it, the more I have enjoyed it. When purchasing the ipad, you probably should plan to spend some $50 on additional applications. Apps are not too expense, but you may want 5-10 applications to help you get what you want out of the ipad. One bonus, most ipod touch games work with the ipad, so you have access to all of those games and software. Unfortunately, one of my biggest reasons for wanting the ipad was to have a portable office. So far, I have yet to find any software (free or buyable, that really provided me with the office I wanted. The closest program so far has yet to be ported to the ipad, and the ipod version does not work correctly. On the other hand, the ipad brings a new feel to gaming. It is unique, fun, and enjoyable. I enjoy the gaming on this far better than the nintendo DS (stylus) gaming. It is fun, and there are hundred's of games for both the ipad and ipod touch to keep you busy for a long long time. In the end, I am someone who wanted an ipod touch, but with a larger screen, and I got it. I didn't care for an mp3 player (I have one). So I basically wanted a palm pilot with a large enough screen to be able to surf the web and read pdf's comfortably, and that is exactly what it is. Trying to make it more is what leads to disappointment and the lower score others are giving it. It is not fit in your pocket portable, but if it was, then you wouldn't be able to read and use the web comfortably. It is portable enough for me to take along in the car on long drives, take to a friends house, bring along on vacation, and do all the things with it that I would need on the go, without the need for a bulky keyboard or an inconvenient stylus, but I wouldn't "drag it everywhere with me", since it is too inconvenient for that. It is a 4 out of 5 because although I like it, it is lacking a couple of things that I think are no brainers. Some of them you can download at a cost, but I just would have expected them to come with the device free, such as a viewer and editor for .doc and .xls documents (word and excel), and a to do list. (seriously, you have to buy and download a to do list, they couldn't just give you one for free). If there are so many free widgets and gadgets out there, then why do ipad apps, which do no more or less than a widget of similar ability, have to cost $2-$5 each?Update: I figured I should reiterate what I mean with the portable office and my score. Yes, they offer "pages" and "numbers" at a cost of $9.99 each, but besides costing $30 to get all of the software needed (powerpoint, word, excel equivalents), they also limit the fonts used and are not the software I would choose. I would have expected at least a free viewer to be able to look at these files, but you have to spend money on that (good reader is what I purchased). For a device centered around the idea of being a very slick and portable itablet, they didn't put any effort to ensure it could do what an actually itablet computer can do. They should have thought of making a document viewer and editor come with it with limited features. Eventually, companies will come out with them, and I will purchase them at a cost of $10-$15 when a decent one does, but it is something almost required on this kind of device, but absent. There desire to nickel and dime customers with there apps is incredibly apparent, almost every free app either has ads, or tries to get you to buy their paid for version. Many of the free games constantly tries to get you to make "ingame" purchases. And seeing how easy it is to make a purchase once setting it up, definitely make sure you kid doesn't touch it or you could end up with a $200 bill easy. So Apple Ipad gets a 4, because for all its' potential, apple limits you so it can get every penny out of you it can. </content></review>

<review><summary> iPad -- the good and the bad </summary><name> JJ Rock </name><date> 2010-04-20 </date><rating> 3 </rating><content> The iPad has potential to be a decent device.  After using it for a week, some general strengths and weaknesses.The Good- Excellent battery life (actually pretty amazing)- Great glossy screen (but also a negative)- Fast, no noticeable lag- Good balance between size and usability- Similar to the iPhone, so easy to learn- Apps developed for the iPad show real potential, some are excellent already- VIdeos worked great- Real potential as a gaming platformThe Bad- Glossy screen loves to show fingerprints and glare- No multitasking so using it as a notebook replacement is tough (too much flipping around)- USB charging requires high power USB port.  Many USB hubs will not charge the iPad- Lacks a native file system, ways to store files on it are clunky at best- WiFi issues, I had problems with dropouts where my MacBook Pro is fine- Using iWorks apps felt clunky, I wanted a keyboard and mouse- iBooks app is great, but content is currently lacking (that will improve)The current iPad falls a little short of me recommending it but the idea is a good one.  Apple can fix some of the shortcomings with a new release of the iPhone OS (v4).  But my money says iPad v2 will be the sweet spot in a year when Apple takes another shot at it. </content></review>
<review><summary> Lovely - but could be so much more </summary><name> Doctor.Generosity </name><date> 2010-04-18 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> When people hear I bought one of the first iPads they tend to ask: But what will you use it for? It's just a big iPod Touch! Actually I had very specific purposes in mind and most of them are working out well so far. A bigger iPod Touch is just what I needed! Number one purpose is that I need to read a lot of scientific journal articles for my work. The archives and current issues of these are all available online now; I was recently able to take 30 years of back issues from my shelves to the recycling station. The iPad is perfect for sitting up in bed in the evening and reading not only these journals but also the New Yorker (which has current issues plus archives back to the 1920's), Popular Science ditto (check out an issue from 1941, fascinating!), and many others. (By the way, Kindle does not yet have a browser and cannot access these.) Number two, when I travel I want to be able to sit in a restaurant or bar or hotel room and surf the Web. My iPhone will do this but it's just a parlor trick; the screen is far too small to read comfortably. Number three is that I would like to keep my "to do" list and calendar and contacts on one portable device - why go to all the trouble of synching back and forth?I am pretty happy with iPad so far. It is a lovely device. But as with many lovely things in this world, a little experience makes one wish for more. With a few days usage I realized what I really wanted is for the iPad to be the center of an integrated modular system which would cover all the functions I need in my life - laptop computer, media reader, and phone. Apple is now maintaining two different operating systems; OS X for personal computers and the iPhone OS. For the iPad they chose the latter. But the big screen leads people to expect more functionality from the iPad. I forsee a gradual convergence of the two operating systems - it seems inevitable.For example, I do want to type on the iPad occasionally but the built-in touch screen keyboard I found to be useless for more than a word or two. How can one type with fingers hovering over the screen for long periods? So I bought the Bluetooth Apple keyboard ($69). It is a significant addition which makes the whole package a lot more usable. I am writing this review on it now. Every iPad needs an auxillary keyboard.Then there is the question how to combine the iPhone and the iPad. I am definitely not willing to pay ATT for a data plan for both on 3G since I can obviously only use one at a time.Put these things together, and here is my proposal. Are you listening, Steve Jobs? The iPad should come with a keyboard attached just like a normal clamshell laptop. Whichever operating system it started from, it should end up having all the functionality of a computer. But the keyboard would be detachable, and the screen half would then become a freestanding iPad with touchscreen becoming active. As for 3G wireless network access, the iPad component can remain WiFi only but be able to tether by Bluetooth to the iPhone, where it will serve as a `big screen display.' This means when I sit down somewhere, I'm not restricted to the iPhone but can have a bigger screen for Web surfing, which is now so difficult on a pocket device. Perhaps there would also be a headset, and a rear facing camera in the iPad for video conferencing. One does not every day need a phone to be the size of a candy bar; sometimes it is nice to be more comfortable if a table is available. It should be possible to make calls from the iPhone, from the iPhone tethered to the iPad, or from the laptop configuration as a portable office.In other words, I see a modular, integrated system based around an iPad form factor at the center, which incorporates keyboard driven laptop, touch driven display iPad as a detachable standalone, and finally tethers as a big screen auxillary for the iPhone. The parts mix and match, and are seamlessly tied together by Bluetooth and a single operating system. It switches from touchscreen to keyboard/mouse at my whim. This would be a complete personal communications, productivity, media solution and in my opinion would be irresistable to users. In return for my suggestion Steve, you may send me one to test. </content></review>
<review><summary> It's a big-ass iPod touch. It's not a Mac. It's not a netbook. But it still has its place. </summary><name> Shoot Me </name><date> 2010-04-17 </date><rating> 2 </rating><content> THE IDEALImagine this: A tablet Mac with a pressure-sensitive touch screen that turns Photoshop into a one-stop Wacom-killing portable graphic design supersolution. It has a built-in iSight camera (as most Macs do) so you can video Skype with anybody in the world at any time, thereby creating a revolution in telecommunications and the eventual death of the cell phone! 3G is built in, so you can video chat any time without needing additional hardware peripherals. It has (at least) one USB port, just like the MacBook Air, so you can upload your pictures to iPhoto easily... unless you shot your photos directly from the iPad's iSight camera (which BTW swivels to either be front-facing or outward-facing). The device runs OS X just like any other Mac, so you can run all of your professional graphic design or pro audio applications on it, with the touch of a finger! That's right, it runs a version of OS X that fully supports pressure-sensitive multi-touch functionality. The price is between $1000 and $1500 depending on the configuration you get.Since hearing early rumors of an Apple tablet this is what I imagined and was hoping for. Now I am disappointed because my idealist expectations have not been lived up to. But enough about what isn't - let's discuss what is...THE REALITYThe iPad is not a Mac. It's a big-ass iPod touch. No, it's not even a big-ass iPhone, or something that can replace a phone. It's a big-ass iPod touch. It doesn't support Flash, or any other Adobe products. Steve Jobs has made enemies with both Adobe and Google now and you, the consumer, are bearing the consequences. OK, to be fair, it's not entirely Steve's fault, but he doesn't appear to be cooperatively working toward a solution for us. It lacks an iSight camera, so forget video chatting. There is only one port on it, which is the 30-pin connector for syncing with iTunes and charging. If you want to pay extra for the adapter, there is one that will allow you to plug in your USB camera or SD card. It makes sense when you consider it from Apple's perspective: allowing standard USB functionality would mean that you could just plug in your own thumb drive (or hard drive) and instantly upgrade a 16GB model to a 48GB model (or more). For me this all feels limiting since I am used to being able to open Finder and see/edit all of my documents, software, even system files, and transfer them to any external device. This leads me to my final gripe: All of the software you install on this device must be approved my Apple. It all goes through the App Store, folks. That means you can't install things that Apple doesn't like... i.e. torrent software, adult content, competing browsers like FireFox, your cracked version of the Adobe Creative Suite (not that I would do this), and all open-source software. Even if Apple approves some competitor's software (like Skype and Dropbox), they can pull those titles from the App Store as soon as they decide they dislike them. This disempowers you as an end-user. Apple is asking the masses to surrender their computing freedoms and since the majority of consumers don't grasp these concepts it is allowed to continue. 1984 was not like "1984", but 2010 sure is.Also, if you already own an iPhone and pay ATandT $30 a month for 3G data, get ready to do it all over again with the iPad. That's right, $60/month if you own both!On a positive note, I commend both Apple and ATandT for making the 3G version free of a 2-year contract. This is exciting news. Another pleasant surprise of the iPad has been the price. It ranges from just $500 to $830 in cost, depending on the configuration.CONCLUSIONSEven though the iPad is nothing like what I had been hoping for, can it be a solution for some people? YES! Yes, it can.The people who will benefit most from the iPad are people with simple needs looking for a cheap portable computer. It's not for me, but I can't say that it's not for some people. It's a cool device for kids to play games on or for your grandma to send you emails from, but it's not for multimedia professionals or die-hard Mac people. It's not a computer and we just have to accept that.Can it do some things that a Mac can't? Yes! It can run almost all of the same apps that your iPhone or iPod touch can, which is pretty cool. And most importantly, it has portable versions of all three iWork applications. This means you can create documents, spreadsheets, and presentations on the go. The iWork apps are a step in the right direction for the iPad, making it more computer-like. I have been a fan of iWork since its initial conception on the Mac and it has always been easier to use and produced more professional-looking results than anything MS Office (or even Open Office) has had to offer. But don't expect the iPad versions of the iWork titles to boast the same full set of features as the Mac versions.To be fair, we must also consider that the iPad platform is still brand new and we will surely see many more apps released for it that will be useful to many people. OVERVIEW OF AVAILABLE SOLUTIONS1. iPad - Best for reading e-books, running apps, watching videos, web-browsing, emailing, creating simple documents, and listening to music.2. Hackintosh netbook - Apple hates them, but they're the cheapest portable platform for OS X and they do the job! I admit, I'm a fan.3. MacBook Air - It's a bit large, it's lacking in ports, it's overpriced, but it's lightweight and it's the smallest Mac you can get.4. ModBook - For those who just must have an Apple tablet. It's basically a Wacom screen tablet fused with a MacBook. Cool, but expensive.5. iPhone/iPod touch - You should be familiar with these by now. One is a phone with a paid internet subscription. The other is Wi-Fi only.6. PC netbook - Eeewww! Don't do this. You're only hurting yourself. (Linux users are somewhat excused)  :-)7. Amazon Kindle - The iPad has succeeded in making the Kindle and other e-book readers obsolete. Don't get it.Thanks for reading. I hope this review has been helpful. </content></review>
<review><summary> Not without flaws, but certainly more than just a glorified iPod Touch! </summary><name> S. Showalter </name><date> 2010-04-16 </date><rating> 3 </rating><content> Having spent some serious time with Apple's iPad since its release, it's easy to see how the device can stir up so much excitement and so much disappointment from all different angles with much less middle-ground. People tend to either love it or hate it. I hope I can shed some light on the details of real-world iPad usage, not just blind claims like several non-iPad users seem to be screaming. I'll detail all the benefits and the caveats of owning the device I've found so far, with hopes that you'll get a clear picture of whether or not the iPad really is for you.===== Background and Initial Reaction =====I'm a mobile app developer who's created apps and games for the iPhone, iPod Touch and now iPad. Leading up to the announcement of the iPad, several rumors surfaced about Apple's new tablet device within iPhone development circles. The big rumor was that it would likely be based on the iPhone OS (the operating system built for the iPhone/iPod Touch). I had a lot of mixed feelings about that though. Part of me wanted the iPad to be able to run standard Mac apps (which the iPhone OS simply cannot do), while the other part of me saw the potential for app developers to take full advantage of the iPad's bigger screen and multi-touch interface on a whole new level, as iPhone/iPad apps generally aren't available for the Mac or PC specifically. What this meant for future iPad users was the potential to do more with the iPad than you would be able to do with an ordinary Mac or PC, though there would be some compromise therein until Apple or other developers could create an app that would fill any gaps in functionality.When announced, I was fairly critical about how similar the iPad was to the iPod Touch. Indeed it does seem like an oversized iPod Touch, especially with the overly huge icons (and excessive spacing between them) on the home screen. Only 4 additional apps per-screen are permitted on the iPad (24 total) than the iPod Touch (20 total). But while iPad isn't without flaw, nor is it a complete laptop or desktop replacement by any means, it's still certainly more than just a glorified iPod Touch. After spending some time with it, the differences quickly become evident.Neither is it a "Kindle killer" though it is certainly a great e-reader that will have a lasting effect on the future of digital books and publications. Moreover, there is a definite potential for the device to be useful beyond everything it is currently being touted as by Apple. Consider what the iPhone can do now compared to its first version with nothing but Apple's standard iPhone apps (before the app store was created).===== First Impression =====Taking the iPad out of the box for the first time, you'll come to realize just how touch-worthy the device really is. The slick screen reflects your glossy-eyed likeness as you gaze upon it and inhale in that one-of-a-kind scent synonymous with brand-new electronic gadgetry. Wrapping your hand around your new baby to embrace it for the first time, you find new meaning to the term "baby" because the back feels smooth like a baby's butt. And there's no doubt that this is exactly how Apple wants you to feel when unboxing the iPad for the first time.Right away, you'll probably notice that it's heavier than you might expect for such a slim device. For a real-world reference, the weight is comparable to that of two 200-page magazines (or 400 pages). Why so heavy? This thing's got two massive batteries which give it that touted 10 full-hours of life with wifi, though I got eight full hours out of constant Netflix streaming. Either way though, such a great battery life is something the iPhone/iPod Touch can't, uh... touch! Another contributor is Apple's signature glass touch-screen. However, the glass screen is phenominal at preventing scratches and ensures the display will always be crystal clear... at least until you lay your greasy mitts all over it.Smudging of finger oils is an issue with just about any touch screen device, but the iPad is special. It has an "oleophobic" coating that should repel the greasy smears, streaks and fingerprints. After using it a majority of the first day, it became evident that the coating doesn't work 100%. It resisted much better than the iPod Touch, which has no such coating, but you can expect there will still be some traces of oil residue from the skin contacting the screen. Washing your hands frequently helps reduce this, but you'll really only notice it if you try to notice it (by either reflecting light off the screen, or turning the screen off). So ultimately your experience interacting with the iPad will hardly be affected by such smearing--there won't be any blurriness or ill effects. However, do note that oleophobic coatings usually start deteriorating after a few months, so expect it to degrade over time, and eventually wear off completely, resulting in more pronounced smearing.One of my bigger grievances with the iPad is the utter waste of screen real-estate. I'm specifically talking about the excessive 1" black margin around the sides. What is the deal with that? Surely Apple could have thinned that out and either made the actual screen slightly bigger, or made the iPad itself slightly smaller. It really disheartens me for Apple to have squandered such valuable space on rubbish like that. The margin should have been the size of the margin used for the 13" or 15" MacBook Pro or the iPhone/iPod Touch--about half an inch.While on the subject of wasted space, I'm also equally disappointed with the excessive spacing (padding) between the app icons on the home screen. Just like the much-smaller iPod Touch, you can only have four apps per row (i.e. four columns) when in portrait mode (orientation in the upright position), though an additional row has been added. On the other hand, flipping the iPad to landscape mode (on its side) enables you to have one additional column of apps, though you lose the additional row that you get with the iPad's orientation set to portrait mode. Meanwhile, the iPhone/iPod Touch cannot show apps in any orientation other than portrait/upright.Either way, in both iPad orentations, it seems like Apple could have fit an additional column of app icons between each other, though five or six columns in portait mode (and six or seven columns in lamdscape mode) would satisfy my preferences. In any case, at least the iPhone OS 4.0 update (scheduled for the iPad this fall) will bring "folders" to the iPad, a feature that allows you to better-organize apps on the home screen by grouping them into a single icon whose app collection is revealed in a popup region.===== So What Can This Thing Do? =====When Apple first announced the iPad they didn't tout it so much as an ebook reader as they did a "netbook killer" (due to its ability to surf the web, check e-mail, watch videos, listen to music, and do a lot of the simpler tasks that netbooks were originally designed to do. Thus Apple had put less weight on the iPad as an e-reader in their announcement, which is still very apparent now that the iPad has been released.Despite the fact that it has begun to spark a revolution in the publication and delivery of full-color magazines and news, in addition to its support for reading e-books, Apple has taken a low-lying strategy with their iPad as an e-reader or "Kindle killer" as some iPad users have touted. When you go to Apple's website, and browse the guided tours that Apple has made for the iPad, you'll see that the guided tour for Apple's e-book reader app "iBooks" is near the bottom of the list. (Just below it is Apple's guided tour for its iPad productivity suite "iWork" which lets you edit Microsoft office documents such as Word files, Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations). What they don't exactly tell you outright is that iBooks (or iWork) is not included on the iPad out-of-the-box. They're extra applications that you have to download from Apple's iPad app store.Having not bundled the iBooks app with the iPad, Apple seems to be positioning the iPad as more than just an e-book reader. Despite the fact that you have to download iBooks, the app itself is indeed free, though the books themselves aren't (of course). As a courtesy though, and as a sort of demonstration, Apple decided to throw in a Winnie the Pooh book for free. What a nice gesture, Apple!On the other hand, to use the iPad for editing office documents, you'll need to download Apple's productivity suite iWork, a trilogy of apps which consists of: Pages, for word processing; Each of the three apps can be downloaded separately for $9.99 each. Completely reworked for the iPad, the complete iWork suite will set you back a whole thirty bucks. So be aware of that before you go ahead and grab the iPad for use with work-related document editing, and so forth.Also note that if you do intend to use the iPad for heavy writing or word-processing purposes, you'll find that your ability to type quickly will be greatly inhibited by the virtual keyboard. Thus, you should snag the external keyboard as well (Note: I'll also explain some typing techniques below). Either way, be prepared to pay more than merely the price for the iPad alone. There's clearly more than meets the eye if you intend to transform the iPad into something a little more productive than it might be for you out of the box.===== Interaction Experience =====The iPad is fast and responsive, and touch interface is phenomenal on the same level that all of Apple's other touch-screen devices have been to date. With the iPad, Apple brings a whole new meaning to the term "multi-touch". The iPad touch-screen supports up to ten simultaneous touches, assuming there is ever a need for that, and given that the developer of whatever app needs that many touches has integrated support for that many touches. For example, the most common app supporting ten simultaneous touches is the piano app.Being touted more as a Web browser and email device than an e-book reader, plus with the added potential that you'll be using the iPad to edit office documents, typing on the device can quickly become a concern. First off, realize that the iPad is not a laptop in the sense that you aren't going to be typing at a speed that I would consider fast enough to be conducive for heavy usage like writing a book, posting articles on blogs or typing lengthy emails. With that in mind, there are a couple approaches you can try to determine what' typing method is right for you. The ideal method might also change depending on where you are and how the iPad is oriented when using it.Typing Method #1:The most common and most flexible approach is to type with your thumbs, which can be done whether sitting or standing. To do this effectively, the iPad should ideally be in portrait mode--I'll explain why in a bit. Grasp the bottom of your iPad with your palms facing each other, and your pinky fingers towards you for the iPad to rest on. To stabilize the iPad and prevent it from flopping over and falling out of your hands, stretch both of your index fingers upwards towards the top of the iPad as much as is comfortable. Proceed with using your thumbs hunt and peck the keys on the virtual keyboard to your heart's content.This typing method works best with the iPad in portrait orientation (tall/upright position). It can also be used like this in landscape orientation (wide/sideways position), though I find it much harder to reach the central keyboard keys with my thumbs without the edge of the iPad interfering (constantly hitting the web of skin between the thumb and index finger).Typing Method #2:I've found this next method to be even more useful, though it requires you to be is best used while seated, with the iPad in resting in your lap, or on something soft, preferably with the iPad in landscape mode. With the iPad situated securely on your legs, you'll find it becomes easier to type with your full range of digits (fingers), like you would on a full sized physical keyboard. Also noteworthy is that Apple's black case that comes with the iPad can be folded over, which tilts the iPad into a better typing angle.I found it slightly awkward, though, to hit the spacebar frequently with the side of my thumbs as you typically would on a physical keyboard. Still, whether you use your thumbs for the spacebar, or decide to use your fingers instead, you'll still find yourself typing slightly faster than with the thumbs-only hunt-and-peck method.Also, this typing method doesn't work well with the iPad resting any anything hard and flat like a desk or table, as the rounded backside of the iPad causes it to wobble uncontrollably while trying to type. However, if placement on a hard surface is a must, you might try putting something soft under the iPad to stabilize it.Other methods of typing on the iPad include the aforementioned external keyboard, as well as speech-to-text transcription apps. The latter includes the Dragon Notes app from Nuance, but I've found its quality in transcription to be laughable at best.===== Web Browsing =====Alongside email, and spending money in the app store, Web browsing is one of Apple's biggest suggestions for using the device. The iPad was born to surf the Web, and its screen resolution of 1024x768 tends to concur, especially in landscape mode. Most websites are around 800-1000 pixels wide, so when the iPad is in landscape orientation, Apple's Safari Web browser will render any sites that are less than 1024 pixels wide at their intended original size, meaning you see them at their true size, rather than seeing a smaller, more compressed version of the site.In general though, I tend to prefer browsing the Web in portrait mode, since web pages are almost always taller than they are wide. Still, even in portrait mode, the iPad allows you to see more content at a decent size, Of course, even in portrait orientation, the compressed pages rendered are still easily readable without squinting your eyes, which isn't often the case for Web browsing on the iPhone/iPod Touch. Plus, you can always zoom into any section by double tapping any region of the active page. Even zoomed-in regions are displayed with crisp clarity, and working within the Safari browser interface is swift and responsive.However, not all your sites will work desirably on the iPad. Apple is closed-mindedly refusing to support Adobe Flash on the iPad (as it has with the iPhone/iPod Touch). Regardless of whether you like it or not, Flash is being used around the Web, not only for advertising and video but for many other uses from graphs to product comparisons. The same lack of support is true of Java, AIR, Silverlight and others. So expect some of your sites to only be supported to a certain degree, if not entirely in rare cases. This can be a bit of a bummer until Flash starts being replaced with other technologies like HTML5's canvas technology, which is poised to take on some of Flash's most familiar capabilities.===== Email =====Email on the iPad's Mail app is best viewed in landscape mode, as it allows you to see both your list of messages on the left as well as the selected message itself on the right. It also makes managing emails easier, such as moving messages to other folders (or to the trash). Another reason for landscape mode is to make typing those lengthy emails easier (using typing-method #2 mentioned above).You can have multiple email accounts, including Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange and other custom POP3 and IMAP accounts.Overall, The Mail app is fairly simple to use. It's easy and quick to read and answer your emails, but in general it's not very powerful. For example, there is currently no support for a unified inbox, but support for that will be added in the fall with the iPhone OS 4.0 update.Important Note: With the growing number of portable web connecting devices, there is one concern I want to express on your behalf. When you close the Mail app, it continues running in the background, even after disconnecting from one WiFi hotspot and reconnecting to another. My concern with this is that if haven't set up your e-mail with a secure connection, and you connect to a public WiFi hotspot that a malicious user is monitoring, then the instant your mail app connects to the hotspot to check your e-mail, your e-mail credentials may be suddenly compromised. To avoid this you definitely want to be using some kind of secure connection for your e-mail if at all possible. Web-based email such as Gmail typically support this out of the box, and Gmail accounts are the easiest to setup on the iPad.===== Media =====If you own an iPhone or iPod Touch, it's comforting to know that you audio/video experience will be similar on the iPad. You can watch videos via the YouTube app, which has been updated for the iPad to show YouTube HD videos beautifully. While the 1024x768 resolution of the iPad is a standard 4:3 ratio, not a widescreen 16:9 ratio, the HD videos as well as other video (including downloads from the iTunes store) display just fine.The Netflix app was also a pleasant and much-welcome surprise, as I'd been waiting over a year for Netflix to put out an app for the iPhone/iPod Touch. While it isn't that, it is indeed just as good. Netflix videos stream quickly and even moving the play position back and forth in the timeline, the movie starts playing very quick without much time rebuffering the video.===== Photos =====Two words: No camera!But thinking seriously about this, would you really want to take pictures/video with this device? You might look kind of awkward. I can't say that I've felt the urge to whoop out my iPad and shoot a photo yet. On the other hand though, logically speaking, Apple should have put the camera up front (as a webcam) instead of on the back, to make the iPad more versatile as a video-chat device for use with apps such as Skype. Ultimately, though, I think Apple couldn't make a decision on exactly where to put a camera. Even on the front, they would have to put it either at the top (optimized for portrait mode) or on the side (optimized for landscape mode). I'll admit, such a decision would be tough, which might explain why Apple decided to nix it all together.Of course, that left an open market for iPad apps that could help bridge the gap. Now, there are a couple apps that allow you to pair your iPhone to your iPad, take pictures with the iPhone, and then subsequently send them to your iPad. First, download an application called "Camera A" on your iPad. Then on your iPhone and grab the "Camera B" app. One of the apps will be free, the other is 99 cents, but for that 99 cents you will get the ability to take pictures with your iPhone and save them directly to your iPad through the Bluetooth connection.===== E-Reading =====Whether it's books, magazines or news, the iPad isn't just making history, it's making an impact on the future of media reading on a whole new level. Apple has been under-emphasizing the e-book and e-publication reading capabilities of the iPad to date, but I feel it's one of the iPad's greatest strengths, regardless of how heavy it is. Fact is, the iPad is still a game-changer. After all, it's lighter than 98% of other laptops with the same sized screen. It is becoming crystal-clear just what the iPad means for the publication industry. This goes far beyond simply reading e-books. Magazine and newspaper publishers have been jumping onboard the iPad bandwagon by creating their own custom apps that take their publications to a whole new level, but interactively and financially.My experiences interacting with some of these new digital representations of magazines and newspapers have been a breath of fresh air. Being able to read them on a screen simply isn't enough. The ability to still touch them, combined with a rich interactivity on a level that can't be matched by their printed counterparts has really given new life to what I feared was becomming a dying trade. Of course, another big perk for me has been the ability to save space because now I can keep all my magazines around without ever taking up more than the size of a single magazine (since the iPad is comparable in size to a single magazine).As far as e-books go, you're not losing out by passing up on the Kindle, because you have full access to Kindle books on the iPad via Amazon's Kindle app. That's not to say that the iPad is a Kindle killer by any means, as the two devices are distinctly different, and both offer a very unique experience. If you read a lot of novels, or prefer to read outdoors, and you don't mind reading in shades of gray rather than in full-color, then the Kindle was indeed made for you, as the Kindle is lighter and the display is easier to read in the sunlight. However, that doesn't mean the iPad would serve no purpose to you, even as an e-reader, because it can read Magazines, News and even the Web on a level that cannot be matched by the Kindle (at least not yet). Besides, no one said your choice was limited to one device or the other. Get them both, if it tickles your fancy!All physical aspects aside, the iPad is definitely a great e-reader, just on a whole new level. Those touting that the iPad is just a glorified iPod Touch, however, probably don't realize this important distinction: the apps being put out by publishers are iPad specific and cannot be used on the iPod Touch nor on the iPhone.===== Gaming =====If you're like me, you probably don't have time for games. Ultimately, I still se the iPad as a productivity device more than as a gaming console. Regardless, it may still be high-time to let the kid within you roam free from time to time, as I do. Alas, it may just be time to Without a doubt, millions of people use their computers for gaming, and with the iPhone and iPod Touch having taken on a clear role as a gaming console that has been as revolutionary for mobile gaming as the Wii was for living-room gaming, it goes without saying that the iPad is, and will continue to be, a decent platform for playing games.I see board games and lap-friendly games being the most popular on the iPad. Meanwhile, I suspect that games heavily dependent on rotation and other accelerometer-based interaction may quickly wear you out do to the weight of the iPad. I got tired of playing EA's Need For Speed: Shift after about 5 minutes. Resting the iPad on my knee didn't help much.===== Productivity =====Productivity carries numerous definitions. Usually its "getting something done" though some people tend to believe that it's the ability to focus without being distracted, which I see as one of the iPad's strengths considering it currently does not support multitasking (yet). In the context of software though, applications that allow you to edit office documents are commonly referred to as productivity software. Apple's own suite of productivity apps, collectively called "iWork", has been re-created from the ground up just for the iPad. (Previously it was only available for Macs.) For work-minded individuals, it will probably one of the most popular uses of the iPad. There are three apps in all: Pages is a word processing app that allows you to create and edit word processing documents. Then there's Numbers, which allows you to create and edit spreadsheets. Finally there's Keynote, which lets you create or edit presentations and slideshows (including PowerPoint files). So far, I've found the latter to be pretty invaluable in giving personal presentations within small groups or one-on-one meetings.However, there is a whole category of iPhone and iPad-specific apps dedicated to productivity, and are consequently located under the category titled "productivity" in the categories section of the app store. Remember, any app that works for the iPhone will run on the iPad, but do note that there are some exceptional productivity apps made or updated for the iPad specifically. Some notable iPad-specific productivity apps include Bento (personal organization/information management), Things (project management), iTeleport (remote desktop/VNC), Layers (drawing/painting), and GoodReader (best PDF+ reader around).===== Printing =====Notice that I haven't said much about printing so far, as there is no perceived way to print from any of the iWorks apps, nor from email, nor Web pages in Safari. This is a potentially huge flaw, especially for people who want to use the iPad for editing office documents. This, if nothing else, is what I think sets the iPad apart most from desktops, laptops, netbooks and even other (Windows-based) tablets. There are apps that support printing, but they have been quirky to use and typically require a printer that supports them and the details of what you can and cannot print varies widely between the available printing apps.===== Security =====With portable devices, there should always be some level of concern regarding the safety and protection of your data. The iPad  deliver surprisingly well in the area, providing several layers of security to protect your data. You can require complex passcodes to securely access important information, encrypt data whether stored or transferred over WiFi, and even remotely wipe everything from your iPad instantly in the event of theft or loss (with subscription to Apple's MobileMe service).===== Technical Specifications =====Amazon's product descriptions tends to be a bit lacking so here's all the technical jargon geeks have come to expect when researching new gadgets.

There are apps for that, but there should be a universal method for printing if you're going to use this for productive purposes.===== The Bottom Line =====Despite several disappointments, the iPad is a device worthy to be in a class of its own. This is a good and a bad thing, as it's certainly no laptop nor netbook replacement. But there is a lot of potential. Apps from the app store, built especially for the iPad, will be what makes the iPad shine, as more and more developers see its potential and start coding world-class apps for the device. It may not leave your pockets or wallet happy, but if you want to take the iPad from good to great, there are plenty of "apps for that". Given all my tips, I think you'll find the iPad to be a usable device, with a deceptive price (given upgrades, apps and AppleCare). And just like every other Apple fan, you'll get over its flaws. There's always hope for Apple to improve on the iPad 2G in another year or two. I hope you've found my hands-on review helpful. :). </content></review>

If you happen to read the negative comments first, let me just say that they are people who simply dislike Apple products, or jealous of the media attention that Apple gets.  Most of these "reviewers" don't even own one.If you have an Apple store nearby, drop by and experience it yourself, not just the iPad, but any Apple product.  Have a great day! </content></review>
<review><summary> Best for workouts on elliptical and More </summary><name> I hate to review </name><date> 2010-04-16 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> FIRST, THIS IS A PERSONAL  "USE" REVIEW.   IT IS NOT A "SPECS" REVIEW. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A "SPECS" REVIEW, THIS REVIEW IS NOT FOR YOU.  THERE ARE A LOT OUT THERE.Having said that, ..........I love my IPAD!!!!!!It is so much smaller than a notebook and so much thinner than a netbook. On top of that, I use my iPad alot for web surfing, emailing, watching movies, and reading while on the elliptical at the gym.   Soon my gym  will go wifi, but right now I use my  sprint overdrive wifi hotspot to connect to the Internet. I can do the elliptical now without ever being bored. And with the os upgrade in the summer, it will be even better.No other gadget at this time is big enough or small enough for this use alone. I'm losing weight so much easier. An hour and a half of workout is no big deal now. In fact, the time just flies and I sometimes go way beyond. I have to restrain myself!Also, I have heard that an iPad is just a glorified version of iPod but it is so much better than that. It is lightening fast and very responsive. People who say their notebook is just as good or good enough  are kidding themselves. Why? Because iPad is so much smaller. I     just slip it in my purse with my overdrive wifi hotspot and go.  Boot up time is almost instant, so I can get on the Internet anywhere.  Also, netbook is not the same either. Why? Because iPad is so much faster and with the iBook and all the iPad apps, there is no comparison. On top of all the above mentioned things, the battery life is awesome. No notebook or netbook can come close to ipad's battery life. My uses of web surfing, netflix movie watching and emailing gave me about 8 hours of use and I still had about 30% of battery life left. Sure, it doesn't have the battery life of kindle ebook, but kindle does not do all the stuff that the iPad does, so iPad is the winner here as well.So, while I love my iPad, I only gave it 4 stars  because it does not have  sd card slot, USB port,  camera, etc. But having said that, I don't even miss those functions at this time for my uses.  iPad is not replacing my laptop, it just adds to my life experiences beautifully. </content></review>
<review><summary> Great device, some seriously rough edges </summary><name> C. Franz </name><date> 2010-04-16 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> Summary: The iPad is beautiful, gorgeous device. It is, perhaps, one of the first true consumer computing devices -- excellent for content consumption (web, video, audio, books), Superb for one-on-one presentations (demos, photos!!!, presentation slides) but with only mimited use for content creation (writing, spreadsheet work, image manipulation). The jury is still out on games, but I expect a slew of great real-time strategy games in the near future. There are some seriously rough edges and oversights, especially when synching and sharing documents. Yet, in light of what's available today, the iPad is still a truly wonderful casual computing device that I recommend to anyone. Exterior: I admit it: I'm a sucker for design. Holding the iPad for the first time was an exhilarating feeling. It's simply beautiful. Glass, Metal, Black. Perfect heft, perfect dimensions. The gentle curve of the backplate. Put simply: the iPad simply *feels* right. The iPad is roughly the size of a US magazine ( 30 cm (12 inch) across, of which 24 cm (9.7 inch) are touch screen. i.e. somewhat smaller than A4). It's weight lies somewhere between surprisingly hefty and optimal (this becomes somewhat of a liability when you read holding it single-handedly). The brushed aluminum backplate - it's much, much better than the iPod Touch's polished chrome, and feels better than the plastic from the iPhone. The outside is mostly clean, broken only for the dock and audio connectors, and a grand total of three buttons (volume, home, and screen lock -- the latter a welcome surprise). While the curved back looks great and certainly feels natural while holding it, I was afraid that it would somehow be wobbly when put on a flat surface. It's not. The only outside connectors are audio (the headphone connector also provides an integrated Mic connector), and the iPod dock connector. Unfortunately this means that there is also no SD or CF card connector, meaning that all such devices must interface with the iPad via an adapter. This is disappointing. Downright cheap is the fact that Apple chose not to include any headphones in the package. You may say what you want about those white earbuds (mostly agree that they are crap), but it's the thought that counts. At least I want the choice to discard them for myself. Hardware: The screen is just gorgeous, with astonishingly good viewing angles. It's bright enough to read outside (except in direct sunlight), and the colors are crisp and vibrant. The screen is glossy, which unfortunately reflects light too easily (significant glare). The glass surface is allegedly oleophobic (i.e. it supposedly is 'fingerprint-resistant'), but as you might expect it does pick up fingerprints quickly. They do wipe off easily, though. The 4:3 aspect ratio is great for showing off photos and presentations, but HD videos will display with black bars. My unit came with 64 GB, *without* 3G/GPS. Unfortunately, to me, 64 GB is way too little storage (we do a lot of photography, and my camera alone holds a 32 GB chip). I would have preferred 256 or more GB storage. Speaking of cameras - the iPad has none built in, which may disappoint many people who would have expected it. I don't really miss it, but suspect that Apple will soon incorporate one into one of the next versions. One annoyance is the fact that there is only one dock connector and only one headphone jack - both on the short edge. The iPad can double as a picture frame, and I would have loved to use the iPad that way in landscape orientation when it's not in use. Alas, since it can only connect to the dock in portrait orientation, I'll have to wait until some inventive soul comes up with a solution (a landscape dock). I would have preferred if Apple had provided two dock connectors. The iPad comes with a built-in speaker wich may even be stereo. It sounds mono, tinny, and weak, but is noticeably louder than the puny little thing built into the iPod Touch. It may be loud enough to watch video on a plane, but definitely is enough to watch one on a train and car ride. The iPad comes with WiFi 802.11n - which is fast. Reception range is somewhat sub-par (compared with other WiFi devices), but is well within acceptable limits. It also has Bluetooth built-in, which I use to connect a wireless keyboard (nice touch: as soon as you connect the wireless keyboad, the on-screen one disappears. Even niceer, most common keyboard shortcuts work, and 'ESC' dismisses auto-completion. Annoyingly, the arrow keys usually do not work to choose an item in a pop-up menu)). I've also tried to connect a bluetooth headset (worked), and a mouse (no go). Finally, the dock connector has again undergone some changes. While I can connect the iPad to my car integration, some other 'built for iPod' Some iPod accessory devices work only in limited fashion: while they are able to access sound and some are able to remote-control it, they won't charge the iPad. [Update: it appears that these devices do charge the iPad, but only when it is turned off, otherwise the power drain is too great] Finally, the iPad has an ambient light sensor so that it can dim the screen in dark rooms, and increase brightness when there is more light. Using the iPad. Immediately when using the iPad, you'll face one glaringly disruptive obstacle. You must sync your iPad to a Mac or Wintel PC, and you must synch it to iTunes. Even worse, you must synch via USB. This issue comes up later again (when using the seriously flawed file sharing). The large touch screen and instantaneous response to touch make this device immensely usable and enjoyable. Few things are as satisfactory as going over a design or photo spread with a client or famly member and be able to touch, flick, pinch, and zoom in on details. Same goes for maps and other visual interaction. Of note: for some businessws this is an integrated presentation device that is hard to beat in price/performance. The home screen interface is a curiously sparsely populated grid of 4 x 5 apps, which looks plain silly. Either the app icons should be larger, or you should be able to pack more icons on a page. As with the iPod Touch/iPhone you can flip though multiple pages of apps. Perhaps the biggest disappointment with overall usage is that the iPad is tied to a single person. In a household or small office where many items are shared, I would have liked to have small 'personal corner' for email and some other things (playlists etc.) that was only accessable to specific users. iTunes (desktop) As with the iPhone you must synch the iPad before you can use it (really annoying). You can only synch it to one iTunes account. App management is similar to the iPhone: drag the apps to arrange them in screens. Integration is tight and works reasonably fast. My initial synch took well over 30 minutes, but that was mostly due to large amounts of data being transferred (50 GB of music and images). Synching data (documents) with your desktop clearly shows the limits of iTunes here. It's a painful, difficult, and entirely unintuitive process, using one of the most braindead file sharing metaphors ever envisioned. Apple must improve this immediately. The iTumes/iPad apps on the iPad are a strange mixture of the iPod and Mac interface. One big disappointment is that neither (iTunes nor the iPod app) can open shared Libraries on the WLAN. In an environment like a home or office it makes sense to store all digital media on a central repository and have external devices access it. We do it at home and in the office. Yet, the iPad can't access these Libraries but must download them. The iPad comes with fewer standard Apps than the iPhone, of which i feel that Mail, Safari, Maps, and Photos are the most important ones (the Bookstore is currently not available in Switzerland where my account is tied to). Mail is a curiously mixed bag. It's definitely great to read emails, and you can see your inbox down the left side of your screen. Still, as with the iPod/iPhone version, you can't get a unified view of all inboxes, only that of the currently open account. Writing emails is trying at best - better than on the iPhone, but to me the lack of integration with other content creation apps makes writing emails something taht you'd only do for short messages. Using the on-screen keyboard is good enough in landscape orientation for that. Safari (Internet) is glorious. No Adobe Flash support, as everyone knows, and unlike with the iPhone, it hurts much more on the iPad. Other than that, though, speed, and 'touch-surfing' make it a thoroughly rewarding experience. The bigger screen (compared to the iPhone) suddenly transforms the touch/multi-touch interface from a good concept to a great experience. Pages load and render quickly, but by no means are rendered as fast as on my desktop. Which is usually ok with me, as 'slower' is relative, and fast enough for me. The Maps application has gained a new terrain topology mode. As with Safari, the increased screen estate makes all the difference. While the iPhone/iPod Touch was a stop-gap measure, the iPad's map app is simply great. Now, my iPad has no GPS (unlike those that come with G3), so it has to rely on inprecise triangulation of WiFi hotspots. That being said, I envision that the GPS-equipped iPad will give dedicated GPS devices a run for their money, including aviation and maritime navigation. I wish my (admittedly old) Garmin Pilot III had only a fraction of the map capabilities of Maps. Photos... Well, I have to admit that I was stunned. Photos simply look great. And since I work in image processing, i'm not easily impressed. As I said before, taking images and presenting them to your client on the iPad is something close to magic. Unfortunately, as before, iTunes appears to downsample images, which I really, really hate. But all in all, the iPad is a supreme presentation device. I'd also love to be able to directly download photos from my camera into the iPad (Apple has announced such a device). However, since my camera uses 32 GB storage, the iPod would be filled much too quickly in it's current configuration The other apps to me are rather insignificant (Video, Contacts, YouTube), with the exception of Calendar. But after trying to enter two new entries into that app, I've decided to not ever talk about that experience again until Apple significantly enhances that clunker of interface. App Store Again, the App store is a killer feature. It gives you access to a great selection of software that you can purchase and download in seconds. The iPad is compatible with software written for the iPod Touch/iPhone - in a way. Those apps either run in a tiny space at the center of the screen, or in '2x' enlarged mode. Unfortunately, '2x' is actually '4x' more, as each pixel is doubled both horizonatlly and vertically, giving the application a blocky, perhaps even retor '80s look. I did not (could not) download the eBook reader application - but did not have to, as there are other readers already available in the App store. Now, there are dedicated eBooks reader (Amazon's own Kindle) available. I have no idea ghow the iPad compares to those devices, ad I don't own one. But I *can* say that reading books on the iPad is definitely enjoyable, even though youi can't really do it single-handedly. The kicker, though, is that were able to bring all our documentation (in PDF) onto the iPad, and now always have it available in a nicely readable way. This alone makes the iPad worth the cost. The iPad still lacks a way to print, though. Dedicated iPad apps can be great. As with the iPhone version of the store, usability, price, and quality vary greatly. Generally the price point is above that of iPhone apps (curently Apps range from $10-$45). Purchasing an App is quick, seamless, and works great. Once you purchased an App, it starts downloading and installing by itself. Should a download be discontinued due to loss of network or any other unforseen event, it picks up where it left off as soon as the iPad reconnects to the Internet. Once installed, it is immediately usable. Once you sync the iPad to iTunes, the purchased App becomes available to all other devices that are synched to that account (provided, of course, they can run it). That way, if you already have an iPhone or iPod Touch, you can immediately use Apps that you already purchased - some of which have built-in iPad modes. SDK The seriously geeky or technologically advanced can download the SDK to roll their own apps. Caveat emptor, though: You must have an Intel-based Mac to use it, have OSX 10.6 (or later) installed. The SDK relies on Apple's XCode integrated development environment. The initial leraning curve is steep, and people not used to Objective-C will at first feel bewilderd. That being said, Cocoa-Touch's framework is comprehensive, extensively documented, and well worth exploring if you are interested in such things. You don't even need an iPad to test your code, as the SDK provides an iPad simulator. In order to install your own apps on your iPad, however, you must be a registered developer (yearly fee required). All in all, the iPad is a great device. It has some decidedly rough edges (synching), and curios omissions (camera, SD slot). While built-in memeory at 64 GB is still on the low side for me, the overall computing experience is currently top-of-the class. The iPad won't replace a fully-blown computer (laptop, desktop) when it comes to heavy-duty content creation. But from what I see it wasn't designed for that (the iWork apps are ill suited for that task). When it comes to content consumption, the iPad is glorious, and in a class of it's own. Pros - drop-dead beautiful device - killer touch interface. Currently nothing comes near in terms of usability - App store - incredibly long battery life - unbelievably crisp screen - best mobile web browsing experience around (flash incompatibility notwithstanding) - Can use iPhone/iPod Touch apps (albeit some only in tiny or enlarged 2x mode) - Apps like Photo, Maps really come into their own with increased screen size - 802.11n networking and bluetooth (latter with ad-hoc networking) - SDK Cons - no webcam, GPS only for GSM enabled iPads, no removable storage (SD slot), no direct USB support - 64 GB limit - battery built in - no Adobe Flash support in Safari - can't connect to shared iTunes libraries, no wirelss synching - no headphones (some may say this is a feature) - single-user mode only - no printing - worst filesharing ever - screen glare - must sync to iTunes. </content></review>
<review><summary> Love my iPad!! </summary><name> Michael Sandler </name><date> 2010-04-15 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> This is probably the first time I ever did this, but I stood on line about 1 1/2 hours, day 1 and got an iPad when it first came out. I've had it 12 days now and I can honestly say it rates 5 stars. I've got an Ipod Nano, but haven't ever used a iPhone or iPod touch, but was able to feel comfortable using it immediately.I sold my laptop on ebay after I got the ipad and although it doesn't do everything the laptop does it covers most of the bases, and does it better. For example, if I wanted to use the laptop it would take 3 or 4 minutes to boot up (Windows Vista) and another minute or two to find the wifi connection in my house. The iPad takes literally about 2 seconds to turn on and I can  be on the internet within 5 seconds of turning it on, it always has the wifi connection. The battery does last about 10 hours as advertised, my Acer laptop would never last much over 2 hours.The ipad is extremely fast, just a little slower than my 2 year old desktop. Using your hands to get around on it is natural and Apple's touch screen works so much better than my Samsung cell phone. The keyboard is easy to use to hunt and peck, I don't think you can do touch typing on it, but it works fine for most purposes, e-mails etc. The biggest negative I can find is sometimes you hit the wrong thing with the touchscreen, it's just not as accurate as a mouse, somtimes it's just lazyness I don't want to enlarge the choices before I make them and hit the wrong one. Overall I'd sell my laptop and buy the iPad again in a heartbeat. </content></review>
<review><summary> Rate it for what it is, not what it isn't... </summary><name> J. Flood </name><date> 2010-04-14 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> We bought the 32G Wifi and been using it for about 10 days now.  This is a review of what the iPad actually IS.  It's not a lot of other things so it's kind of silly to complain about that.  Don't buy it if you want to do something it currently can't do.  Hardly a reason to trash it.  	We are a mixed Mac/PC family with 3 students scattered from elementary school to high school.  This was bought as a gift instead of a Macbook with the enthusiastic consent of the 13 year old who will be the primary user.  It is still probably riding the initial rush any new "toy", but I can tell you I'm seriously contemplating buying another when the 3G version comes out.  The second would be a pure luxury purchase admittedly.  This first one though is definitely going to be over subscribed for the foreseeable future as far as I can tell. 	To begin- It's a fascinating piece of technology.  It would probably make a great primary computer for someone who doesn't really need a real desktop or laptop most of the time.  (Grandparents, etc.) Going forward I'll recommend this instead of the Mac minis I've steered people to over the last couple of years. So far we've only gotten the black cover from Mac as an accessory.  It synced easily with our existing iMac and iTunes and immediately uploaded the existing iTouch apps.  I also bought the Pages and Numbers apps for 10 bucks each.  I downloaded both the Kindle app and iBooks to compare.  I also added NPR, Netflix, The Weather Channel app, and the 14 dollar Elements Book/App.  I synced his playlists and tossed on about 500 pictures from last year and this year.  I'll delve a little deeper into most of these.The Screen- The screen is very impressive.  It really makes the device what is it obviously.  Then again it sucks up fingerprints to an amazing degree.  Cleans up easily though and you adapt pretty easily to the change.  I can't see how to avoid this problem when you're touching the screen constantly and still expect a flawless picture.  The E-readers-  iBooks wins on the pure look and feel aspect.  It may just be a temporary effect, but reading in iBooks just felt more like reading a real book.  Kindle wins on the amount of books and cross platform compatibility.  I think I trust Amazon more at this point to keep any purchased books in a format I can count on for a longer period of time.  I have to admit, I'm not fully confident in either company's willingness to port this format 10 or 15 years down the road.  I'll probably stock up on any free books in iBooks for now and purchase anything I need from Amazon's Kindle store.  I haven't sat down and read a full book "cover to cover" yet, but I've done some lengthy stretches with both apps.  Please don't hate me, but I found reading on this to be more enjoyable than reading on a Kindle.iPhoto-  Pictures look amazing on this.  I was very easily able to set up slideshows and pair them with tunes from iTunes.  Most of the shots I used were a little over 5mb originally and ported with the ability to zoom in close quite clearly.  I included 1 shot of us standing next to the 20th Maine monument at Gettysburg.  While not really in view in the original shot, I was able to zoom in and read the individually inscribed names very clearly.  This app really wows people with the clarity of the screen/photos.  The sound is pretty good for the size of the device but not amazing.  Safari (Browser)- I'm familiar with and use Safari regularly at home so I found the web experience to be normal for the most part.  I noticed occasional blanks where I guess flash apps would be, but I'm more of a news reader.  I haven't spent a huge amount of time surfing on it, but it seemed fine when I did.  No complaints from the other family members.  Netflix - This was a surprise.  I didn't realize how well this would work.  We were watching The Office within a couple of minutes and the screen is big enough that two can watch and still have it be an immersive experience.  Of course not everything on Netflix is available for instant view, but it's a free app and we're already members so I can't complain.  This was very easy to setup and I'd recommend trying it to anyone.Pages- this the Apple version of Word and on the iPad it's the light version to boot.  That said, it a pretty nifty little word processor that he's used to do homework already.  You have to sync it to iTunes and then open the doc with the full version of Pages or Word.  Here I have a pretty big beef with Apple.  I've got Pages 08 which I bought in late 08 as part of iWorks.  To sync you have to have Pages 09?!  Word 97 is supported but not Pages 08?  I happen to have Word for Mac so it wasn't a big deal but I was really ticked off at the time.  You might even be able to export as a .doc and then load into Pages (didn't think of it at the time) but I don't know for sure.  Either way I can't believe Apple wouldn't support this out of the box.  Anyway, it worked out fine even if it wasn't terribly intuitive.  Going forward he can do it on his own with no problem.Specialty Apps - NPR/Weather Channel - I can easily see people getting a little out of control in designing their own apps for no real reason.  Both of these were free and pretty well executed though.  There are many of these out there but I had read reviews on both of these so we started with them.  I imagine we'll add and delete apps frequently over time.The Elements: A Visual Exploration- A very impressive educational e-book app that was highly recommended and that I spent a lot of time playing with and reading.  This was a little pricey for an e-book, but it was also rebuilt as app to take advantage of the iPad video capabilities including 3D (haven't gotten the glasses yet).  It's really another wow factor app when showing the app to people. Pro's.    Undeniable cool factor right now (that will fade, I know).   	Beautiful executed form and basic functionality.	Reasonable cost factor for the level of functionality COMBINED with the ease of use and intuitive UI.	No wifi connectivity issues so far.	Light weight.	Con's    The things it doesn't have - camera specifically.	The Pages 08 incompatibility.	Learning curve for some basics functions	Printing more cumbersome than it needs to be.This is the longest review I've written by far for Amazon, especially considering I didn't even buy the iPad here.  I thought it was important though to get a fairly evenhanded review (yes, I know I like Macs) out there from someone who has actually paid for and used an iPad.  It is not for everyone.  If you have a Kindle already there's no reason you shouldn't keep it and continue reading with it.  If you're an Apple hater because of their DRM/closed garden, I totally understand.  If you're a power PC or Linux user you'll probably have something you can tool around with to your heart's content shortly.  For a pretty large group though, I think this is a very viable option to do a lot useful/fun things without traumatizing your already overworked friend/relative who's also your IT guy. </content></review>

<review><summary> iPad is NO replacement for a Netbook, infact, I don't know what it is at all.. </summary><name> M. D. Jacobs </name><date> 2010-04-13 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> Apple has produced a device even THEY cannot explain. They just expect their legions of fans to do the hard work and come up with the suggestions. Having bought one of these and played with it for an hour, I am none the wiser as to what this thing is for, needless to say, i took it straight back! Its awkward to hold, its actually quite heavy (although feels nice), the screen is too bright, could hardly see it at all outdoors, wrong aspect ratio for movies etc etc. I knew what this thing couldn't do, but i'm still unaware of what it CAN do! All i see it as is a portal into Steve Jobs pocket. Don't be fooled - this thing is next to USELESS. I see a market in those annoying lifestyle, starbuck-sipping fashionista types, who have to be seen with stuff like this, but the sensible among you take heed and get a top of the range netbook with a longlife battery - you'll save big money AND have a better machine capable of unlimited applications. </content></review>
<review><summary> PC users beware! </summary><name> Deej </name><date> 2010-04-12 </date><rating> 2 </rating><content> First let me start off by saying this review is from MY experiences. With that said, I was thinking of getting a netbook b/c I have a 17" notebook which is heavy and difficult to carry around on long or short trips. I decided to get the iPad instead knowing the flaws like no Flash websites, no USB port etc. What I have found is that 100% percent of the reviews I read prior to buying failed to mention a lot of small detail left out for the average user. I don't own an iPhone or iTouch so I may mention features that are already familiar to people who own these devices. There are many apps but only a few are any good and most of the good ones you have to pay for. I purchased a game "Super Monkey Ball 2" for iPad and it looks and plays great! I tried the Netflix app and to my delight I was able to stream a movie and it looked really good. Now keep in mind that these new TV/Blu-ray players that have netflix streaming, you have to have an unlimited Netflix acct to stream movies and I have the 2 at a month plan so this is A+ for me. Now I can sit on the sofa or in bed and stream a movie. Sometimes the wifi signal is not strong when using the net and you will get a timeout msg that reads "Safari Cannot open page because the server stopped responding". Also, for those of you who haven't heard some of the iPads have connectivity problems when re-connecting to an already established wifi connection. Apple says only 2% of iPads have this problem. Either I have really bad luck or Apple is low balling the percentage as I have this problem with my iPad and I purchased it on day of release. It's really annoying and you either have to wait like from say 10mins to 2 days to re-establish the wifi connection. It's unpredictable. Now for PC Users, you can NOT charge this device from your computer while syncing. You will get a message next to the battery level that reads "not charging". I went to the Apple store to complain and the workers had never heard of this problem. I had to investigate and figure out that the iPad users I spoke with in the store were Mac users. The employees at Apple really don't know jack about the iPad except for what you've already seen and read. It's very frustrating and I fault Apple for being over-kill on the secrecy (sp?) of the products. Finally I read the manual and it specificly states that the iPad must be charged from the wall charger. If you are like me your wall outlets are filled to the max. I was going to return it and was told that a 10% restocking fee would apply which is $50 so I kept it. LIKES: I like the Google maps app. I got directions and put the device in the car and it holds the map/directions even though I lost the wifi connection. When I got lost, all I had to do was drive to Micky D's and get a free wifi connection and even though there isn't GPS in the wifi model, it will map to your current location which is great. I found I was only 6 blocks away from my destination. I have a problem reading the small type in Thomas Guides (CA residents know what this is) so being able to enlarge the map made reading the streets a pure joy. The iBook store will let you sample read any book you have an interest in. The sample comes in the form of a download to your bookshelf. You can enlarge the font but you only have two sizes to choose from. The backlit is great b/c I sat on the sofa reading a book without the need of extra light and the room was completely dark. The page turning is very fluid and instead of swiping you have the option of just tapping the screen and the page will turn superfast. It's great for using in the bathroom on the toilet and I know some of you do this, I've seen the photos online! lol I have also used the internet radio while in the shower. You sit the iPad on the counter and turn it full blast. Full blast is not distorted but it has it's limitations. If your bathroom has a fan, you won't hear it while showering. I was driving to work on the freeway and was listening to an audiobook with the iPad in the passenger seat with the windows rolled down since I don't have air conditioning. It was a lost cause b/c traffic drowned out the volume of the audiobook. I downloaded the digital copy of the latest "Batman" movie and it looked and sounded great! Though you can't multi-task yet, you can listen to songs you've preloaded on your iPad from the speaker and still browse the net at the same time. It's great using the iPad at the dinner table instead of lugging and proping my 17" laptop on the table. Hardly takes up any room on the table. I love the calendar as it has an alarm that goes off even when the iPad is powered off. I totally forgot an appt I had until I heard the alarm on the iPad and read the msg. The iPad fell off the counter about 3ft to a carpeted floor and did not break and still works 100%! Not on purpose mind you, I'm not that stupid. lol When you remove the iPad from the box it has a think plasitc wrapping around it. Keep this! As I found that the iPad doesn't resist fingerprints as claimed. However, I found that keeping the plastic sheet on the iPad will protect it from fingerprints and it's still fully functional. You could also buy a screen guard but this is the ghetto screen guard as I like to call it. Hey, I saved money. Plus you can easily remove it and put it back on when needed. DISLIKES: I do photography so I was excited to find you could load photos on the iPad. What I don't like is that you have to do it from iTunes and sync the folders to your iPad. You cannot delete photos directly from your iPad even though you can click on a specific photo and a delete button will appear but when you touch it, nothing happens. I read the manual and it confirmed you cannot delete from the iPad itself. The manual itself is not included with the iPad, you have to read the manual from the Apple website for which the iPad has a built in fav link to the manual. the thing is if you are having a problem and don't have a wifi connection, forget reading the manual. There is a youtube app and videos stream really fast with hardly any waiting. You cannot rate vids using the youtube app even if you are logged into your acct. Everytime I would press the rating, nothing would happen but I notice the youtube website has been revamped to only include a like or dislike button. The youtube app hasnn't been updated to reflect this change. If you go to the youtube website and login, it took me 10mins to load and play a 2min HD video. Even though it is also an eReader, the iBook app has to be installed. It's free but what it doesn't do is sync ibooks you have purchased from other sources so don't think you'll have a one-stop iBook shop. Also, very few books on iBook. Don't think just b/c a book is popular or from a known author that you will find it on iBook. For instance, they have no iBooks by noted author, Maya Angelou who wrote and read President Clinton's inaugural poem. The keybooard takes some getting used to. While it is QWERTY you have to keep your fingers in the air like pretend typing and extend each finger to the letter you want but eyes must be kept on the keyboard or you'll easily type the wrong letter as a standard keyboard you can feel where the keys are. Also, there is something called predictive text where you will start typing and a word will pop up underneath your word it will show a word it thinks you are typing. Luckily the people at the Apple store explained to me how this works. If the word that pops up is the word you are typing, then you hit the space bar and it will insert or complete the word you are typing. The thing is if you are abbreviating a word and not looking it will insert the wrong word. For instance I was leaving a comment on facebook and I typed "OMG" but when I hit the space bar the iPad inserted "OMB". I didn't notice until I left the comment. This device has a copy and paste function which I understand is on the newest iPhone, well this function is annoying b/c it pops up all the time when I'm not trying to copy anything and I know no way to turn this off. It fills the screen with the sheer blue coating that prevents you from doing anything until disable it which I have to exit from the page and return.Most apps or pages allow you to enlarge the font on the screen or do the finger stretch thing but some don't and if you don't have the greatest vision could be hard to read.  Mostly I find this on the iPhone apps I installed on the iPad. The search function on the iBooks app leaves a lot to be desired.  You can only search exact titles or authors. If you want a subject matter like "gay", the results will not bring up books on that topic. You have to know the specific name of the book or author.It has one speaker so watching movies with the speaker on won't give you stereo but if you plug in headphones, viola! stereo sound.In summary if you are on the fence, wait for the HP Slate or 2nd generation iPad which will have built-in multitasking which should arrive mid-summer. If I like the HP Slate then I will sell the iPad but I find the more I use it, the more I like it despite it's flaws. If you live near an Apple store go try it out for yourself. </content></review>
<review><summary> Apple taking advantage of certain consumers </summary><name> Unhappy Apple </name><date> 2010-04-12 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> I was very disappointed when I finally got my hands on this ipod touch with a big screen, a "magical device". Simply put there is nothing magical about it. I have been using a windows-based tablet since 2003, and it has more advanced technology and capability than apple's 2010 Ipad. The biggest paradox is that despite people calling this the apple ipad tablet, it's not a tablet at all, you can't take hand-written notes on it. The one thing that would have been able to define a new category of device would have simply been that. Furthermore there is:no camera, no usb ports, no easy way to organize a file system and transfer/copy, no easy way to print your files, no interaction with office productivity software (Office), the on-screen keyboard is not practical, the screen resolution is 4:3 so you see movies with huge black bars, there is no HDMI out so you can't connect it to your new LCD, no card readers for your photos,no flash support for websites (rendering 50% of the web useless), there are wifi issues (connections dropped), the screen is glossy so you can't read on it outdoors, no multitasking supportridiculously low storage space (even netbooks have over 200gb now)it's very fragile and slippery in your hands (one drop could kill the screen)it will set you back $600 (the price of a full-featured laptop)I could go on for a while but I'll just stop here. What is frustrating is that Apple obviously has the technology to include these things easily, so it was purely a short-term business decision on their end. For the moment, they are blatantly exploiting certain consumers' willingness-to-pay for the ipad. They are taking advantage of their brand recognition and marketing power to extract revenues from a purposely made sub-par product. The only way to stop this type of behavior is to either stop buying bad products (sounds easy but people aren't always rational), or wait until competition kicks in over the next six months. I hope this business plan doesn't come back to bite them in the end, in my opinion they are definitely playing with fire on this one.On the plus side because of these omissions, it's simple (a grandma could use it), it's fast (but this is because it doesn't run a real operating system) it has ok battery (9 hours) and it's thin (although not light, you will get tired of holding it after 5 minutes).In one sentence: You're paying $600-1000 for a semi-portable web-browser which gives you access to about 30% of the web.Hope that helps you make up your own mind, I returned mine after 48 hours. </content></review>
<review><summary> Great for my son with autism </summary><name> CK </name><date> 2010-04-12 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> My 8 year old son has autism. His $6,000 communication device burned out about 2 months before the iPad came out - so we started looking. This fantastic device has a communication program (Proloquo2go) that is PERFECT for him. So what we have now is a fabulous multi-tasking device for my son. He communicates using PLQ2Go, he can also read books we download (The Cat in the Hat, etc.) or they can be read to him. He has horrible handwriting, so in school he can use the Notes application to type, which is great since we can hardly interpret his handwriting. There are educational apps (spelling, math, etc) which will help reinforce what he is learning in a fun way. One con I have is using the device in a noisy location (classroom with lots of kids) - you need an external speaker, which we have on order. We are VERY terrified of him dropping it, but as we have few alternatives, I'd rather replace a $500 device than a $5000 device (neither of which are covered by insurance). We have a binder/cover on order - and I'll look for a padded travel case as well which should have a handle. But this is just the thing for us. My other complaint (not sure if it's ipad related or not) - I personally hate the app store - at least via the iPad. I cannot find much unless I know EXACTLY what I'm looking for, and in searching for educational apps that my son can use - it's only by luck that I find anything. I think I need some tutoring, and will get to that when I have a free moment (ha!) but otherwise I recommend this as a great AAC device. (p.s. the Proloquo2go works great on the iPod phone and touch - which my son will probably graduate to - but he needs the big screen right now). For those of you who are complaining that it's a larger or heavier iPod, or not as functional as a laptop, etc. Then don't buy it. But you won't convince me. I've been using my son's - and now I want my own! Books, email, etc. I don't have a laptop (I have a desktop) and I like this because I can carry it around the house and use it while I do things with my kids. Last night I was playing Monopoly with my daughter on the family room floor while tracking some of these packages that I'm expecting. Also, there are apps that I can download which I haven't even explored yet. </content></review>

Even though I'm a Mac-only person, I never had an iPod or an iPhone, so I think that many of my problems arise from that and will probably go away in time.Right now I'm not sure how to answer the great Wizard of Oz question:  good witch or bad witch?GOOD WITCH:~light, small, and I didn't have to play the whole "how many books in my purse?" game for the transAtlantic flight~beautiful screen~great battery life -- I read the new Maisie Dobbs all the way across the pond~holds a massive number of books and movies, and I've got just the 16gb model~gets you into many interesting conversations BAD WITCH~hard to keep it turned off when not in use and that's bad for draining the battery~steep learning curve if you don't have an iPhone or iPod-touch~pages on book-mode turn too easily unless you keep a perfect grip on it~hard to prop up on a table to read while eating~no substitute for a real book when standing in line, sitting in bright sun, falling asleep ...~no way (yet) to directly up-load pix from camera~no real photo software~hard-to-use documents software~wireless connection not all that enthusiastic compared to my laptop~sloooooooooooow to charge up, which is a real issue when there's only one outlet in your hotel roomSo am I glad I bought one?  Well, sort of.  If I weren't traveling, I might be more grumpy, but the book/movie thing alone is certainly sufficient reason for getting an iPad.PS/News from the front on 4/15::  ~the Netflix thing -- which doesn't work in Europe, so I hadn't tried it when I wrote the review -- is AWESOME.  Netflix has really stepped up the available offerings, too.~there's a KINDLE app now and you can get books from Amazon that the iBookStore doesn't have.  The special effects aren't as cool, but it's still fabulous to be able to get a book in 10 seconds.  And this _does_ work in Europe.PPS 3 weeks in (4/24)~I'm much happier with this than I was the first week, but that doesn't mean that it's entirely perfect.  ~Nooooooo, it's not a lap-top substitute, nor was meant to be, but if it's gonna offer document software, it would be great if it worked better.~I very much wish there were a way to batch delete mail messages, rather than having to select each one individually.  It takes a significant period of time to clear out a day's worth of messages.~A SAVED box would be great, too.~the worst thing, really, that it DOESN'T have is a camera -- so you can't Skype~there are lots of apps in the App Store, but it's hard to sift out the ones just for the iPad.  More deceptively, there IS a filter for that, but it still gives you iPhone apps, which don't look as cool or work quite as well on the Pad.~I'm very very very glad that there is a Kindle app, because the bookstore is low on new releases, at least in mysteries and thrillers~I still worry constantly about dropping it and eagerly await the arrival of the Apple case.~The wireless problems I grumped about are now famous and no fix in sight.Summary?  still glad I have it. </content></review>

Luckily the people at the Apple store explained to me how this works.  If the word that pops up is the word you are typing, then you hit the space bar and it will insert or complete the word you are typing.  The thing is if you are abbreviating a word and not looking it will insert the wrong word.  For instance I was leaving a comment on facebook and I typed "OMG" but when I hit the space bar the iPad inserted "OMB".  I didn't notice until I left the comment.  This device has a copy and paste function which I understand is on the newest iPhone, well this function is annoying b/c it pops up all the time when I'm not trying to copy anything and I know no way to turn this off.  The search feature in iBooks is not as comprehensive as Amazon.  For example, you can only search exact titles or authors of books.  You can't search by subject mattter.  If you search the word "gay" it will only bring up books or authors with that word. Where as Amazon it will bring up books that fit the subject matter as well as titles and authors. So you have to know the exact book you are searching for.In summary if you are on the fence, wait for the HP Slate or 2nd generation iPad which will have built-in multitasking which should arrive mid-summer.  If I like the HP Slate then I will sell the iPad but I find the more I use it, the more I like it despite it's flaws.  If you live near an Apple store go try it out for yourself. </content></review>
<review><summary> Nice device, but high price </summary><name> LI LIANG </name><date> 2010-04-12 </date><rating> 3 </rating><content> Apple again did a very good marketing. I saw many people rushed to buy it because they saw good reviews and they though it was cool, but not thinking as an adult whether it is really useful. I posted my review on ASUS netbook when it was out at $399, saying it worth $199. That is the price of it in 6 months. For iPad, the cost to produce is about $250. So $350 should be a reasonable price. Note that you have to pay for wireless providers. It is not even close to a laptop, for sure. Will I get one? Probably, but not at this price. Oh, I am sure Apple's CEO is happy that you pay for his dinner. He did a really good job, though. I actually likes a color digital device to read magazines/books, but not that small. I bet either Apple, or other company, will release a better device at the size of a real magazine soon. </content></review>
<review><summary> Nifty, but where are the BOOKS? </summary><name> M. Mendez </name><date> 2010-04-11 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> This is my first Apple device, and for the most part, I love it.  I don't find it heavy (I'm a woman), even to hold for an hour or so; the screen is easy to read from and easy on the eyes, etc.  I bought it primarily to use as a reader.  After waiting for the two major competitors to introduce all of the functions that I was waiting for, I thought the iPad would be the answer, and, as a device, it is.  My huge problem is that ~3/4 of the books I've been waiting to read are not available!  Well this stinks; I've got a gorgeous new device and no where to go...  I was also looking forward to reading periodical content, and like the idea of the latest issue of whatever awaiting me when I get the opportunity to read a bit.  As of now, however, very few periodicals have iPad apps available (paid or free).  I hope this changes soon, otherwise my Used device is going to be for sale here.  So much potential - but it's just not delivering (yet?  I hope!)...I have to amend my review - this is added later.  There's a Kindle app!  The books are available, they were just hiding :). </content></review>
<review><summary> The first affordable tablet computer worth buying! </summary><name> Chris A. Kantack </name><date> 2010-04-11 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> The iPad is my first Apple purchase. Prior to the iPad, I didn't feel that Apple's products were worth the money.  With the iPad however, not only did Apple make a great product, but they priced it quite competitively. I'll list below first what I love about the iPad, then where I feel the iPad falls a bit short.Here's what I really like about the iPad: 1.  Instant on capability to the Internet.     With the iPad you don't have to wait long for it to boot up.  When the iPad is completely off, it takes     about 15 seconds to start the device.  There is also a "standby off" which uses virtually no power and     allows "instant on" capability.  2. Superb web browsing experience.     The iPad comes with Safari, an excellent web browser.  I'm especially impressed with the way I can zoom     in on a page at any size.  (Text size is completely variably-sized, allowing you to fit web pages and text     perfectly with the screen.)  Pages render very quickly (faster than on my many PCs) with no problems.     True, there is no support for Flash but I've found that to be a very minimal "hardship" as the iPad has     other free apps (like YouTube) that compensates for lack of Flash.  4. Bright, easily readable and navigable screen     Though not perfect: (I wish it were not glossy), the iPad screen is excellent.  It's 9.7" size seems     just right and the multi-touch interface works flawlessly.  The way I can intuitively scroll down on      a page makes web browsing and other document reading a real pleasure.  Font support is not extensive but     what fonts are available render beautifully.  The iPad can be read easily indoors or outdoors provided      you are not in direct sunlight.  5. Decent speaker sound and wonderful headphone sound.     The iPad can generate reasonably loud (if not high quality) sound from its built-in speakers.  Of course      it sounds wonderfully if using headphones and/or you choose to feed its audio into a home stereo system.     In addition to the built-in iPod music player application, there are several "streaming radio" apps     available that allow you to use your iPad as an "internet radio".         6. Huge library of new and existing applications.     There are already thousands of applications written specifically for the iPad.  The iPad also does a     decent job of playing 95% of existing iTouch/iPhone applications.  With over 150,000 programs available,      there are applications already available for just about anything you can think of many of which are free.     My application list includes, streaming internet radio, video players, card games, and news/weather     sites. I've also downloaded the iBooks application which is an excellent book reading program.  Many      free books are available as well as a good selection of current titles.           Another great built-in app is "Maps". "Maps" is incredible, not only in its ease-of-use but in its ability     to show your current location.  True, the WiFi only iPad has no GPS but via WiFi signals the iPad can       often compute your approximate location.  7. Great battery life!     I get 10 hours+ per charge with my iPad.  Far better than the max 3 hours I got from my Acer laptop (when     it was new).  Even if you use it to play movies constantly or listen to non-stop internet radio, you'll     get around 10 hours or more use per battery charge.     There are some ways the iPad could have been made better.  Here are the not-so-good aspects about the iPad:  1. Glossy screen has its drawbacks.       My #1 concern before buying the iPad was, "Will I be able to put up with the glossy screen?".  Indeed, now     that I have had my iPad for 3+ weeks, my #1 complaint is the glossy screen.  Under certain lighting     conditions (outside in the shade or watching dark movie scenes indoors or out), the reflections on the     iPad's glass screen become a real annoyance.  A matte like finish on the glass (like what you would find     on most high quality computer monitor screens) would be a huge plus.  2. Awkward to hold without a case.     When I bought my iPad, I also picked up Apple's $40 iPad case.  Glad I did as, without the case,      the iPad is not very comfortable to hold and can easily slip out of one's hands.  With the case, the      experience is entirely different.  Apple's rubberized case makes the iPad comfortable and very easy     to hold onto.  It also provides the iPad with excellent protection and allows you to prop up your iPad     when at a table.  If you buy an iPad, buy it with a case like Apple's that allows you to use the unit     without having to remove it from its case.  The $40 Apple case seems pricey but I wouldn't take my iPad      anywhere without it.  3. Not a stellar "WiFi performer".     I've had no difficulty using my iPad around the house or at work.  But compared to my Acer laptop, the     iPad's overall WiFi performance is weaker than I'd like it to be.  The number of hotspots it can detect     at any given location is only a small fraction of what my laptop can detect. Also, occasionally I'll go to     a restaurant (say McDonald's) that has free WiFi and for some odd reason I cannot get my iPad to connect     even with a strong signal present.  Overall though, I've found the iPad to have a very reliable (if not      very sensitive) WiFI capability.  4. On-screen keyboard a bit disappointing.      Though I feel there is plenty of room for it, the on-screen keyboard does not have the number keys on the     same display as the alphabet.  One has to constantly toggle back and forth between keyboards when entering     alphanumeric data.  I hope Apple fixes this in a future software update.  5. Kind of a heavy unit.     1.5 pounds may not seem like much.  But prolonged use (several hours at a time) of the iPad can cause one     to have sore wrist/hands just from holding the unit.  The longer I've had my iPad the less it's weight has     bothered me.  Perhaps one day, with newer screen technology, Apple can move away from using so much glass     and lower the weight of this unit to under 1 pound.  I've had my iPad for 3 weeks and have been using it extensively for web surfing, TV viewing, PDF reading, music listening, and game playing.  The performance of this device is amazing.  Almost every operation and function responds instantly to your command.  This truly is a versatile device that I'll be using for years to come.  I've been waiting many years for an affordable tablet PC that could do what the iPad does.  My wait is over. </content></review>
<review><summary> So far I'm smitten, and I had high hopes coming in </summary><name> Andrew Lopucki </name><date> 2010-04-11 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> I expected the iPad to perform an order-of-magnitude better than its contemporaries just as the iPhone did.  I was not disappointed.  The feel of it in my hands and the speed with which it responds when web-browsing are perfect.  The big surprise came from the Apps.  The Wall Street Journal App works so well that I now still retrieve the paper WSJ from my sidewalk out of habit, but I set it aside and read it on the iPad instead.  Pictures on the iPad are also substantially better than viewing them on the iPhone (and most of mine were taken with the iPhone!)  But the biggest surprise was Netflix.  When Netflix first starting streaming movies using Flash on the web, that one application would bring my $3000 notebook computer to near melt-down temperature as the processor screamed.  Eventually it would crash before I finished watching a movie.  Many people decried the decision by Apple to avoid Flash on this device, saying it wouldn't be a player in the streaming market.  Well I can honestly tell you that the Netflix App works fantastically well on iPad - better than their web version, and better than the version that streams to my blueray player.  I've watched Netflix every night for the first time ever.The wifi range is no better, and maybe even a little worse than my iPhone on my current network - but that could be because of the router.  The wifi speed on the otherhand is fanstastic.  I've reached upto 4mbps on speed tests.  Maybe if I get a better router it will be even higher.Reading is a pleasure on my iPad.  The action (page turning or otherwise) is smooth and natural.  Some others have said they prefer the Kindle.  I tried the Kindle just the week before I got the iPad and I was shocked to find that it couldn't do many simple, obvious tasks like searching or definitions - let alone copy and paste into a browser for a wider websearch or to quote the text in a paper.  iPad does all of these things fantastically well.  I've had no trouble with eye strain/fatigue thus far and that's a good sign.In sum, the iPad fully lived up to my expectations and that's saying alot considering my discriminating taste when it comes to engineering; just see my other reviews if you don't believe me.  Apple in recent years has consistently delivered while their competition uses up goodwill with customers by delivering crap. (I'm looking at the tablet PC people here - as well as the cell phone and other 'gadget' companies.)  While they make 'smart phones' and 'gadgets' Apple delivers iPhones and iPads.  It feels good to believe in a company's reputation again.  I earnestly hope that continues.Drew LoPucki, Gainesville FL. </content></review>
<review><summary> Love it BUT... </summary><name> HARRY POTTER </name><date> 2010-04-11 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> IT'S REALLY FANTASTIC FOR ALL THE REASONS EVERYONE ELSE WROTE BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE FLASH THAT'S THE ONLY STUPID THING TO ME. </content></review>
<review><summary> Considering the iPad </summary><name> JL </name><date> 2010-04-11 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> Steve Jobs described the iPad as a magical and revolutionary device at the Apple press event that launched the product. So, as an owner of the device, would I also consider it "magical" and "revolutionary"?Well, I don't know about magical as I generally reserve that for unicorns and the like. I've logged several hours on the device since launch day to give you a well-rounded account of the great, the not so great, and hopefully help you know if the iPad is right for you!--Overview:I really love my iPad. Like many, my first impression was that it was just a giant iPod Touch. I've come to realize that's not the case. In fact, it's so much more useful than an iPod Touch, I just chuckle these days when people say this. For me, the applications, utilization of the extra space, and the web capabilities that really won me over. There are a few features I'm really hoping are forthcoming in a future software build that would make the device even more useful. On the whole, the iPad has become an extremely useful device that's got my laptop feeling a bit unloved and jealous these days.--Hardware:There's no denying the iPad is gorgeous. Apple has re-envisioned the beautiful look of the iPod Touch/iPhone in a fuller form. The screen is flawless and (as I unfortunately learned) very resistant to scratching. If you intend to use the device outdoors you'll want to know that the high-gloss on the screen makes it very difficult to see in direct sunlight at times. The speaker and mic are great in this device. The speaker will fill an entire room with sound. Unfortunately, Apple (yet again) put a focus on design over ergonomic. The iPad is a bit hefty, and a bit difficult to hold for long periods of time. It is; however, much sturdier than you might expect from the pictures.The processor works extremely well with the iPhone OS, it's a screaming combination that makes this one of the fastest tablet computers I've used in ages. That being said, much of the software is designed for the less powerful iPhone still. We'll see how the iPad's speed stands up to a new wave of software designed for 1GHz mobile processors soon enough. Initially; however, it's been unimaginably quick.Battery life is amazing. I'm getting at least 8 hours (even watching video) and sometimes more. I also opted for the 64GB version of the iPad. It has plenty of storage for what I've been using the device for, but as my video collection becomes progressively more High Definition, it won't be long before I have to start picking and choosing what I can place on my iPad. This is not something I'm happy about in a device costing $699 + Tax that's so clearly designed for HD video and content. I'm also very disappointed in Apple's decision to not include an SD card reader for the device. This is one area where the HP slate still has a compelling advantage. There are many instances in which, popping in an SD card and being able to access the documents, images, music, and video stored on it would be extremely nice. Apple has planned an accessory for the iPad which will allow you to port your photos to it via an SD card adapter, but that's the extent of its functionality with SD cards. That's a definite delta for me.I have the Wi-Fi edition as the 3G version has not been released yet. I've run into a few instances where it would have been extremely nice to have 3G connectivity. If I had to make the choice over again, I think I would question my decision that everywhere I go has Wi-Fi anyway, and probably wait for the 3G edition. I'd really encourage you to hold out if you think there's any way in which you'd use the iPad regularly outside of Wi-Fi coverage.Just a quick note, I've had none of the issues that other users have reported with wireless connectivity. My iPad has been drama-free thus far. I'll update this review as I encounter issues to keep you aware.--Web Browsing and EmailTwo of the iPad's strongest features are web browsing and email. Safari (the iPhone OS' native browser) is very fast. It's a significantly better browsing experience on the iPad than you'll have on the iPhone. I've found that I really don't use apps for sites like Facebook anymore. The iPad's screen makes it much easier to just visit the actual Facebook site.Even on the iPhone, email has never been so quick and simple. Apple really devised a great approach to email. A quick tap calls up a pain showing you all the emails in your inbox with a brief preview. You can organize, clear, or open email in ways that seem decades ahead of what MS Outlook is capable of. Setting up my Corporate Exchange account on the iPad took less than 60 seconds! It's hard to express what makes email so much better on the iPad than the iPhone/iPod Touch, but you'll know it when you see it.--The ApplicationsThe applications really sold me on the iPad. I can't say enough about the iWork suite (sold separately via the App Store)! This software suite puts a desktop-grade word processing application and presentation software on your iPad. The "Numbers" spreadsheet application isn't exactly as smooth, but is still the best spreadsheet app available on a mobile platform. There are just so many great applications already available for the iPad that I can't list them all. My favorites so far are iWork Suite, Sketchbook Pro, Kindle for iPad, ABC Player, and Marvel Comics App. The extra screen real estate makes this device unquestionably better for media. Even the iPod application within the iPad is much smoother than on other iPhone OS devices. The iPad will also run your iPhone applications, and can double their size to help them fill more of the gigantic screen. Honestly, the iPhone applications aren't much of a selling point on this device. They look grainy and ridiculous on the iPad's screen.--iBook Store/ReaderThe iPad does several things well. One it doesn't do well would be eBooks. The backlit screen is tough on the eyes and the resolution leaves the characters fuzzy. As a Kindle owner, I can honestly say that the iPad is not a replacement for that device. This is pretty much universally true of the eReader applications available for the iPhone/iPad. It may be personal preference but I really don't enjoy more than brief periods of reading on backlit screens. There's a reason 700 page novels aren't backlit = ).--I really wish it had...I really wish Apple would reconsider their stance on Adobe Flash. The absence of the key internet video technology makes the internet a little hit or miss. You'll still have a great YouTube option via the iPad's YouTube app, but little embedded videos on places like the NYT, MSNBC, or other sites are just not there at this point. Let's hope that Adobe and Apple either make up soon or HTML5 catches on extremely fast! Until then, the HP Slate may be a better option for users who really take advantage of web video other than YouTube. A camera would also be really nice, especially a front-facing camera for video conferencing. In a dock the iPad seems almost born to video conference! I doubt I'd be taking many pictures with my iPad if it included just a standard back-mounted camera, but it might help developers do more in their applications.--The Accessories:The iPad uses the same (30-pin) style connector as the iPhone/iPod so it already has a wealth of compatible accessories on the market. If you own an iPhone/iPod, it may even be compatible with devices you already own. Here's the rule of thumb: If you have to dock the iPhone/iPod Touch... the iPad won't be compatible, if you can connect it via a cable, it'll work. This is mostly due to the considerable size of the iPad. Obviously, it's not going to fit in that smaller indentation that most iPhone/iPod docks utilize. I really recommend a case, and dock for this beast. I've owned my iPhone for 3 years and never owned a case for it (until a few weeks ago). I got away with that just fine. The larger screen of the iPad makes it a different sort of device; however, and I wouldn't even think of running around without a case on this thing. It's actually a bit disappointing that Apple didn't include one. I'm sort of glad they didn't; however, because I purchased the iPad case designed by Apple and was extremely disappointed. It's of a very weak felt lined cardboard from what I can tell. Its material holds oil and lint making the screen worse when you close the case. It also has such a tight grip on the device that putting the iPad in or taking it out of the case makes you feel like you might damage it.The iPad really needs a dock! You wouldn't really anticipate it, but having this giant on your counter can really occupy much of your kitchen or desk space. I'd recommend a dock as they generally hold the device upright maximizing the space around it. Apple makes a really great dock for the device that includes an audio-out port. Just note, that the case designed by Apple isn't compatible with the dock. Go figure.If you intend to carry a lot of video on the device, you may also want to invest in a video-out cable. The solutions available for the iPhone/iPod Touch will work for the iPad, or you can opt for the Apple video out cables (they actually aren't too horrible price-wise).--A note about iPhone OS 4:Apple announced the newest edition of the iPhone operating system (which the iPad runs on) last week. Some really great features are on their way that will benefit the iPad a great deal! Amongst the best of them- multi-tasking (run multiple applications or processes at once), geotagging, improvements to gaming on the device, and more! Read up on the new OS! It should be available for the iPad later this year. Thanks for reading my review! I hope it helped. If you do decide to purchase an iPad, have fun. It's a great device, and don't forget to try out the Sketchbook Pro, and iWork apps. I really love them on mine! </content></review>
<review><summary> Another Great "I" product from Apple </summary><name> Malibucapellino </name><date> 2010-04-11 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> Ok. So there is a lot of hype over anything new released by Apple. Intel Imac's, Iphone and now Ipad. I currently own an Ipod. I, I I.. ha When I first heard Apple was releasing a tablet device I thought it would just be an oversized Ipod/Iphone like a laptop etc. I just went to an Apple store Saturday to look for myself this new item. Is it worth the cost? Any benefit over my Ipod? (For tech stuff see apple.com).YES!! (answer to my two questions above). I recommend going to an apple store or best buy store to pick this up and play with it. It's not as heavy as others have written, in fact its almost as heavy as an Iphone. It was well designed to fit on one or both hands and is very responsive. Yes, it appears to look like an Ipod/Iphone, but turn it on and see the dramatic difference. The user interface (apple's own chip) is classic! User User friendly like all Apple products and comes with many great designed accessories. In reference to one of the reviewers on this site, the IBOOKS and reading a book on this Ipad is great. It looks like a book page, feels like one (turning ability) and great on the eyes. Going outside to read? I took the ipad and started reading a book the store had displayed on the Ipad. The light above was about 4 feet above me and the book looked great. However, like the Ipod, Iphone and Kindle, the reflection on the Screen was annoying, but any screen I've tested (sony,Kindle, Windows and now apple) have the reflection. The store also had this on 2 accessoies. The leather case and the Dock which makes the Ipad stand up. Great 2 products (maybe slightly price inflated, but great). The charging dock allows you to use a bluetooth keyboard and type or watch a movie etc. THe case folds back to allow you to also watch tvshows/movies etc. Upgrades are always done thru apple and the multitasking coming this year will make this Ipad rock even more.OK. Is it time for an upgrade? The cost seems a bit much is it worth the cost? Once again yes. However, I'm waiting on the wifi 3g model.Think of the costs?wifi-free from monthly charges (minus the source: cable, dsl etc)3g- 2 choices both great, but the $29.99 will be my choice.No other monthly charges for phone or text or data. Well, sort of.. he heP.s. Want an amazing Ipod/Iphone combined into one oversized superior version with for only $29.99/mo?IPAD is your choice. Choose your memory size. Choose your accessories now. Yes, Ipad=Ipod=Iphone.  How?Download your music/tv shows/movies and its an Ipod. (DId i mention watching 24 and abc shows for free)Download beejive application and enjoy free texting with family/friends. (beejive costs $6.99 flat one time fee)Download Skype and enjoy a low cost phone on the IPAD. Yes a phone service on the ipad. Skype sounds great on my Iphone and for $2.99/mo  you can call anywhere in the USA and Canada.I'll review again once i receive the wifi3g model in May. </content></review>

<review><summary> A whole new kind of thing - a beautiful device, with so-far-untapped possibilities </summary><name> Nathan Andersen </name><date> 2010-04-10 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> I had a chance to try one of these at a store for about half an hour - so I'm not at all an expert, but thought I'd share some quick thoughts for what they're worth.  I can't claim to "need" this yet, and will probably wait at least until the OS upgrade, but I've gone from being unconvinced to eager.  A little while with one of these was enough to show me it has huge potential, both for home use and in the classroom.  To all the haters and nay-sayers, I say: try one.  It's smaller than I expected.  At first blush it feels like an oversized iPod Touch, but once you get to using it, that impression goes away quickly.  It has the same intuitive feel, and the interaction with the screen is so light and obvious. I didn't really have to think about what to do; my fingers knew (or, rather, the designers knew what my fingers would find out quickly). It's large enough, though, I found there are whole new layers of possible interaction.  Books, obviously - and the way they turn pages, the way they incorporate available graphics, and the possibilities for making them interactive make this device a real game changer. What I like is that it's so much more than just a reader.  Movies, browsing, organizing.  I wouldn't compose documents here, likely, but I think it would be perfect for editing and reading through drafts.  Games, too. I played Poptropica's "Plants vs. Zombies" and was surprised by how much more fun it is to actually point to and touch what you want to do, rather than manipulate a pointer from a trackpad or a mouse.  It's more than an oversized Touch; but it doesn't quite feel like a small laptop.  It's a different kind of thing, and that's a good thing.  It's more mobile and, in a word, handier.  Sometimes I just want to check something, look something up, browse.  This would be exactly the thing.  Sometimes I want to relax and recline.  If you've ever tried reclining with a laptop, curling up in bed with a laptop ... it doesn't really work.  You have to put your hands all awkward to interact with laptops lying down.  They're made for sitting up straight - and are only passably workable for short stretches on the lap or in front of you while lying down on the stomach -- they work best at a desk.  More than that, for some uses the keyboard just gets in the way.  Interacting directly with the screen is a dream.  I rarely like to watch movies on my laptop, and an iPod Touch or an iPhone is really too small to enjoy, but watching an iPad and interacting with it through touch, is quite a delight.  I can definitely imagine curling up with this. </content></review>
<review><summary> Are you kidding? </summary><name> Steely Plumpie </name><date> 2010-04-10 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> If you buy this product you are a sucker.  You are part of the problem with this country, in that nobody thinks about the choices they make or are about to make.  I LOATHE Crapple, but the iPhone is still the best phone/mini PC on the market.  It does a multitude of tasks that the iPad can't.iPad sucker factor:1.  This device is being billed as a web browser, but Apple won't allow Adobe Flash content to be played on it because they're afraid of losing money from the istore.2.  If you want 3G connectivity, which isn't available on the cheapest model, you'll have to spend an additional $150.3.  You can't replace the battery.4.  No camera.There is NO reason to buy this instead of an iPhone unless you have so much money that you scoff at the price, in which case you are DEFINITELY part of the problem. </content></review>
<review><summary> Entirely new class of product </summary><name> W. T. Miller </name><date> 2010-04-10 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> The iPad is an unbelievably cool product!  I've had it for a week now, and it has exceeded my expectations in every area but one.  It is such a pleasurable experience to hold it and interact with the machine.  It is a very intuitive, tactile, and personal interaction with the web.Having a touch screen to interact with the web is a very different experience than using a mouse.It is NOT supposed to be a netbook, so reviews which compare what it doesn't have, miss the point.  This is a whole new computing device to accomplish perhaps 80% of what most people use computers for.For all the basic uses (email, websurfing, music, movies (the Netflix app rocks!), games, ebook, magazine reading (Zinio is great), and the news (the USA Today app is a joy to use) it is great.I have already been finding myself on my laptop much less often than before.The iWork apps are a pleasure to use.  The one area that seems to be more convoluted than it should be, is printing.  You can't print directly from it.  You have to either email it to yourself, or transfer the file over when you sync with iTunes.  But it looks like the 4.0 version of the operating system is going to provide a lot of fixes which people are looking for.A few years from now, tablets like this will be everywhere, and those who are on computers are mainly using them for work.I knew the iPad would be a big hit when my 70 old mother, after seeing mine, decided she was going to get one too!Dr. Bill, [...]. </content></review>
<review><summary> 29 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Buy an iPad -  The Facts </summary><name> Angel_Pen </name><date> 2010-04-09 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> A few reasons why the iPad did not work for me other than the excessive price, some of them never mentioned before:1) The iPad screen is 8x10 thin glass, it is extraordinarily fragile and it can shatter if dropped from a distance of just two feet from the ground. Do not let your kids play with it.2) Heavier than you think. You won't be able to hold it on one hand for more than 10 minutes. You will always need to rest it on a surface.3) The iPad has its Wi-Fi antenna behind the Apple logo, if you rest it on a surface you may weaken the signal. Also, the iPad shortly after it was first released was banned from some Universities due to WiFi interference. Your school or University may ban it too until the issue is solved. 4) The iPad has the worse email implementation on the planet: just like a phone, you can't download attachments nor add your own attachments. Even if you could, you still would not be able to compress or decompress zip files or transfer any files in or out of the device via USB, there is no USB. File transfers are non-existent for most practical uses and it does not show as a disk image either. 5) So far, Apple denies there is anything wrong with their iPads and is still charging a restocking fee for returning an opened box iPad.6) One day you will NEED to visit a Flash site and it won't work because Safari does not support it and never will.7) Apple just announced plans to allow any company to display advertisements on the iPad and the iPhone. Do you really want to pay over $600 for the privilege to get spammed?8) If you own a Netbook you already can do more than what the iPad can do for a lot less money.9) The iPad only runs a few truly useful applications, the other 300,000 apps are gimmicks of dubious value.10) No Photoshop App and no memory card reader = useless for photographers.11) Low screen resolution. Kind of fuzzy and dark video playback. I was expecting better quality from a device in this price range. Movies cost about $20 and the speaker is mono!12) iPad glossy screens reflect fluorescent lights and windows like a mirror. When are they going to learn that we hate that?13) Applying a screen protector on this large screen without leaving bubbles? Good luck!14) You can't print anything from an iPad, not your e-ticket nor your homework, no emails or PDF files, nothing at all. That's just plain dumb.15) The iPad REQUIRES the presence of a Mac or a PC to function. It also requires iTunes to be activated or upgraded. It will not work without either. This is why the Pad is not a laptop replacement for school or travel or anything. You need to carry two devices together always.16) The iPad does not allow you to navigate sites with "mouseover" menus and some java scripts and this includes more sites than you think.17) The iPad does not play high quality movies on your TV after you connect it using the Apple $30 video adapter! They didn't tell you that at the Apple store, did they?18) The iPad does not play anything on your TV unless "video out" is implemented by the App.19) The iPad requires an external charger, if you carry a laptop, camera, etc. You may have problems finding a free outlet in your hotel room.20) Apple "forgot" to include a thick "rubberized" cover right out of the box. Broken glass and kids are not a good mixture and grandma holding a slippery iPad is an accident waiting to happen.21) The iPad can not import "Keynote" presentations created on a desktop/laptop, they will either crash or the images/videos/fonts/formatting will be missing. Only the most simple Keynotes can be painfully created.22) If Apple wants to market this as an eBook reader for students then they should leave out the Games and the high price tag. As it is, it is just an expensive Game platform.23) The iPad 3G is designed to work exclusively with ATandT's limited 3G coverage.24) The iPad 3G can not be tethered.25) You will be lucky if you can auction an iPad for half the current price six month from now.26) The photo memory card "adapter" does not work the way a normal adapter works. The iPad will copy all files that fit on your iPad (not many) but it will only playback certain types of files. For example, no video playback is allowed. Getting the files back out is another instance that requires iTunes and a computer.27) If you turn the brightness to the lowest setting the iPad will disconnect from your WiFi network every time it falls asleep. This has been reported by many users but till now Apple has refused to issue a software update.28) There have been many reports across the country of Apple Store employees discriminating against some costumers, lying about requirements to buy an iPad (which Credit Card to use, availability of a particular model, racial profiling, etc) In short, Apple employees refusing to sell iPads to a specific individual based on their own personal prejudice. 29) More often than not, Apple Stores employees have used high-pressure sale tactics to trick innocent costumers into purchasing expensive accessories or services (like MobileMe, AppleCare, etc.) Falsely advertising these products as a requirement to make the iPad work properly.Not everything is bad. There is one thing the iPad does well: GAMES.(Consider donating your $600 to help a child in need, it is a more fulfilling experience than buying an expensive gadget that you do not really need. Try it and you will see the difference). </content></review>
<review><summary> Great device, some seriously rough edges </summary><name> C. Franz </name><date> 2010-04-09 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> Summary:The iPad is beautiful, gorgeous device. It is, perhaps, one of the first true consumer computing devices -- excellent for content consumption (web, video, audio, books), Superb for one-on-one presentations (demos, photos!!!, presentation slides) but with only mimited use for content creation (writing, spreadsheet work, image manipulation). The jury is still out on games, but I expect a slew of great real-time strategy games in the near future. There are some seriously rough edges and oversights, especially when synching and sharing documents. Yet, in light of what's available today, the iPad is still a truly wonderful casual computing device that I recommend to anyone.  Exterior:I admit it: I'm a sucker for design. Holding the iPad for the first time was an exhilarating feeling. It's simply beautiful. Glass, Metal, Black. Perfect heft, perfect dimensions. The gentle curve of the backplate. Put simply: the iPad simply *feels* right.The iPad is roughly the size of a US magazine ( 30 cm (12 inch) across, of which 24 cm (9.7 inch) are touch screen. i.e. somewhat smaller than A4). It's weight lies somewhere between surprisingly hefty and optimal (this becomes somewhat of a liability when you read holding it single-handedly). The brushed aluminum backplate - it's much, much better than the iPod Touch's polished chrome, and feels better than the plastic from the iPhone. The outside is mostly clean, broken only for the dock and audio connectors, and a grand total of three buttons (volume, home, and screen lock -- the latter a welcome surprise). While the curved back looks great and certainly feels natural while holding it, I was afraid that it would somehow be wobbly when put on a flat surface. It's not. The only outside connectors are audio (the headphone connector also provides an integrated Mic connector), and the iPod dock connector. Unfortunately this means that there is also no SD or CF card connector, meaning that all such devices must interface with the iPad via an adapter. This is disappointing. Downright cheap is the fact that Apple chose not to include any headphones in the package. You may say what you want about those white earbuds (mostly agree that they are crap), but it's the thought that counts. At least I want the choice to discard them for myself. Hardware:The screen is just gorgeous, with astonishingly good viewing angles. It's bright enough to read outside (except in direct sunlight), and the colors are crisp and vibrant. The screen is glossy, which unfortunately reflects light too easily (significant glare). The glass surface is allegedly oleophobic (i.e. it supposedly is 'fingerprint-resistant'), but as you might expect it does pick up fingerprints quickly. They do wipe off easily, though. The 4:3 aspect ratio is great for showing off photos and presentations, but HD videos will display with black bars.My unit came with 64 GB, *without* 3G/GPS. Unfortunately, to me, 64 GB is way too little storage (we do a lot of photography, and my camera alone holds a 32 GB chip). I would have preferred 256 or more GB storage.Speaking of cameras - the iPad has none built in, which may disappoint many people who would have expected it. I don't really miss it, but suspect that Apple will soon incorporate one into one of the next versions.One annoyance is the fact that there is only one dock connector and only one headphone jack - both on the short edge. The iPad can double as a picture frame, and I would have loved to use the iPad that way in landscape orientation when it's not in use. Alas, since it can only connect to the dock in portrait orientation, I'll have to wait until some inventive soul comes up with a solution (a landscape dock). I would have preferred if Apple had provided two dock connectors. The iPad comes with a built-in speaker wich may even be stereo. It sounds mono, tinny, and weak, but is noticeably louder than the puny little thing built into the iPod Touch. It may be loud enough to watch video on a plane, but definitely is enough to watch one on a train and car ride.The iPad comes with WiFi 802.11n - which is fast. Reception range is somewhat sub-par (compared with other WiFi devices), but is well within acceptable limits. It also has Bluetooth built-in, which I use to connect a wireless keyboard (nice touch: as soon as you connect the wireless keyboad, the on-screen one disappears. Even niceer, most common keyboard shortcuts work, and 'ESC' dismisses auto-completion. Annoyingly, the arrow keys usually do not work to choose an item in a pop-up menu)). I've also tried to connect a bluetooth headset (worked), and a mouse (no go).Finally, the dock connector has again undergone some changes. While I can connect the iPad to my car integration, some other 'built for iPod' Some iPod accessory devices work only in limited fashion: while they are able to access sound and some are able to remote-control it, they won't charge the iPad. [Update: it appears that these devices do charge the iPad, but only when it is turned off, otherwise the power drain is too great]Finally, the iPad has an ambient light sensor so that it can dim the screen in dark rooms, and increase brightness when there is more light. Using the iPad.Immediately when using the iPad, you'll face one glaringly disruptive obstacle. You must sync your iPad to a Mac or Wintel PC, and you must synch it to iTunes. Even worse, you must synch via USB. This issue comes up later again (when using the seriously flawed file sharing).The large touch screen and instantaneous response to touch make this device immensely usable and enjoyable. Few things are as satisfactory as going over a design or photo spread with a client or famly member and be able to touch, flick, pinch, and zoom in on details. Same goes for maps and other visual interaction. Of note: for some businessws this is an integrated presentation device that is hard to beat in price/performance.The home screen interface is a curiously sparsely populated grid of 4 x 5 apps, which looks plain silly. Either the app icons should be larger, or you should be able to pack more icons on a page. As with the iPod Touch/iPhone you can flip though multiple pages of apps.Perhaps the biggest disappointment with overall usage is that the iPad is tied to a single person. In a household or small office where many items are shared, I would have liked to have small 'personal corner' for email and some other things (playlists etc.) that was only accessable to specific users. iTunes (desktop)As with the iPhone you must synch the iPad before you can use it (really annoying). You can only synch it to one iTunes account. App management is similar to the iPhone: drag the apps to arrange them in screens. Integration is tight and works reasonably fast. My initial synch took well over 30 minutes, but that was mostly due to large amounts of data being transferred (50 GB of music and images). Synching data (documents) with your desktop clearly shows the limits of iTunes here. It's a painful, difficult, and entirely unintuitive process, using one of the most braindead file sharing metaphors ever envisioned. Apple must improve this immediately. The iTumes/iPad apps on the iPad are a strange mixture of the iPod and Mac interface. One big disappointment is that neither (iTunes nor the iPod app) can open shared Libraries on the WLAN. In an environment like a home or office it makes sense to store all digital media on a central repository and have external devices access it. We do it at home and in the office. Yet, the iPad can't access these Libraries but must download them. The iPad comes with fewer standard Apps than the iPhone, of which i feel that Mail, Safari, Maps, and Photos are the most important ones (the Bookstore is currently not available in Switzerland where my account is tied to).Mail is a curiously mixed bag. It's definitely great to read emails, and you can see your inbox down the left side of your screen. Still, as with the iPod/iPhone version, you can't get a unified view of all inboxes, only that of the currently open account. Writing emails is trying at best - better than on the iPhone, but to me the lack of integration with other content creation apps makes writing emails something taht you'd only do for short messages. Using the on-screen keyboard is good enough in landscape orientation for that. Safari (Internet) is glorious. No Adobe Flash support, as everyone knows, and unlike with the iPhone, it hurts much more on the iPad. Other than that, though, speed, and 'touch-surfing' make it a thoroughly rewarding experience. The bigger screen (compared to the iPhone) suddenly transforms the touch/multi-touch interface from a good concept to a great experience. Pages load and render quickly, but by no means are rendered as fast as on my desktop. Which is usually ok with me, as 'slower' is relative, and fast enough for me. The Maps application has gained a new terrain topology mode. As with Safari, the increased screen estate makes all the difference. While the iPhone/iPod Touch was a stop-gap measure, the iPad's map app is simply great. Now, my iPad has no GPS (unlike those that come with G3), so it has to rely on inprecise triangulation of WiFi hotspots. That being said, I envision that the GPS-equipped iPad will give dedicated GPS devices a run for their money, including aviation and maritime navigation. I wish my (admittedly old) Garmin Pilot III had only a fraction of the map capabilities of Maps. Photos... Well, I have to admit that I was stunned. Photos simply look great. And since I work in image processing, i'm not easily impressed. As I said before, taking images and presenting them to your client on the iPad is something close to magic. Unfortunately, as before, iTunes appears to downsample images, which I really, really hate. But all in all, the iPad is a supreme presentation device. I'd also love to be able to directly download photos from my camera into the iPad (Apple has announced such a device). However, since my camera uses 32 GB storage, the iPod would be filled much too quickly in it's current configuration The other apps to me are rather insignificant (Video, Contacts, YouTube), with the exception of Calendar. But after trying to enter two new entries into that app, I've decided to not ever talk about that experience again until Apple significantly enhances that clunker of interface. App StoreAgain, the App store is a killer feature. It gives you access to a great selection of software that you can purchase and download in seconds. The iPad is compatible with software written for the iPod Touch/iPhone - in a way. Those apps either run in a tiny space at the center of the screen, or in '2x' enlarged mode. Unfortunately, '2x' is actually '4x' more, as each pixel is doubled both horizonatlly and vertically, giving the application a blocky, perhaps even retor '80s look. I did not (could not) download the eBook reader application - but did not have to, as there are other readers already available in the App store. Now, there are dedicated eBooks reader (Amazon's own Kindle) available. I have no idea ghow the iPad compares to those devices, ad I don't own one. But I *can* say that reading books on the iPad is definitely enjoyable, even though youi can't really do it single-handedly. The kicker, though, is that were able to bring all our documentation (in PDF) onto the iPad, and now always have it available in a nicely readable way. This alone makes the iPad worth the cost. The iPad still lacks a way to print, though. Dedicated iPad apps can be great. As with the iPhone version of the store, usability, price, and quality vary greatly. Generally the price point is above that of iPhone apps (curently Apps range from $10-$45). Purchasing an App is quick, seamless, and works great. Once you purchased an App, it starts downloading and installing by itself. Should a download be discontinued due to loss of network or any other unforseen event, it picks up where it left off as soon as the iPad reconnects to the Internet. Once installed, it is immediately usable. Once you sync the iPad to iTunes, the purchased App becomes available to all other devices that are synched to that account (provided, of course, they can run it). That way, if you already have an iPhone or iPod Touch, you can immediately use Apps that you already purchased - some of which have built-in iPad modes. SDKThe seriously geeky or technologically advanced can download the SDK to roll their own apps. Caveat emptor, though: You must have an Intel-based Mac to use it, have OSX 10.6 (or later) installed. The SDK relies on Apple's XCode integrated development environment. The initial leraning curve is steep, and people not used to Objective-C will at first feel bewilderd. That being said, Cocoa-Touch's framework is comprehensive, extensively documented, and well worth exploring if you are interested in such things. You don't even need an iPad to test your code, as the SDK provides an iPad simulator. In order to install your own apps on your iPad, however, you must be a registered developer (yearly fee required).  All in all, the iPad is a great device. It has some decidedly rough edges (synching), and curios omissions (camera, SD slot). While built-in memeory at 64 GB is still on the low side for me, the overall computing experience is currently top-of-the class. The iPad won't replace a fully-blown computer (laptop, desktop) when it comes to heavy-duty content creation. But from what I see it wasn't designed for that (the iWork apps are ill suited for that task). When it comes to content consumption, the iPad is glorious, and in a class of it's own.   Pros- drop-dead beautiful device- killer touch interface. Currently nothing comes near in terms of usability- App store- incredibly long battery life- unbelievably crisp screen- best mobile web browsing experience around (flash incompatibility notwithstanding)- Can use iPhone/iPod Touch apps (albeit some only in tiny or enlarged 2x mode)- Apps like Photo, Maps really come into their own with increased screen size- 802.11n networking and bluetooth (latter with ad-hoc networking)- SDK  Cons- no webcam, GPS only for GSM enabled iPads, no removable storage (SD slot), no direct USB support- 64 GB limit- battery built in- no Adobe Flash support in Safari- can't connect to shared iTunes libraries, no wirelss synching- no headphones (some may say this is a feature)- single-user mode only- no printing- worst filesharing ever- screen glare- must sync to iTunes. </content></review>
<review><summary> Great for my son with autism </summary><name> CK </name><date> 2010-04-09 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> My 8 year old son has autism.  His $6,000 communication device burned out about 2 months before the iPad came out - so we started looking.  This fantastic device has a communication program (Proloquo2go) that is PERFECT for him.  So what we have now is a fabulous multi-tasking device for my son.  He communicates using PLQ2Go, he can also read books we download (The Cat in the Hat, etc.) or they can be read to him.  He has horrible handwriting, so in school he can use the Notes application to type, which is great since we can hardly interpret his handwriting.  There are educational apps (spelling, math, etc) which will help reinforce what he is learning in a fun way.  One con I have is using the device in a noisy location (classroom with lots of kids) - you need an external speaker, which we have on order.  We are VERY terrified of him dropping it, but as we have few alternatives, I'd rather replace a $500 device than a $5000 device (NOT covered by insurance).  We have a binder/cover on order - and I'll look for a padded travel case as well which should have a handle.  But this is just the thing for us.My other complaint (not sure if it's ipad related or not) - I personally hate the app store - at least via the iPad.  I cannot find much unless I know EXACTLY what I'm looking for, and in searching for educational apps that my son can use - it's only by luck that I find anything.  I think I need some tutoring, and will get to that when I have a free moment (ha!) but otherwise I recommend this as a great AAC device.  (p.s. the Proloquo2go works great on the iPod phone and touch - which my son will probably graduate to - but he needs the big screen right now).For those of you who are complaining that it's a larger or heavier iPod, or not as functional as a laptop, etc.  Then don't buy it.  But you won't convince me.  I've been using my son's - and now I want my own!  Books, email, etc.  I don't have a laptop (I have a desktop) and I like this because I can carry it around the house and use it while I do things with my kids.  Last night I was playing Monopoly with my daughter on the family room floor while tracking some of these packages that I'm expecting.  Also, there are apps that I can download which I haven't even explored yet. </content></review>
<review><summary> Use it, then see what you think! </summary><name> The Juicemeister </name><date> 2010-04-09 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> What makes the iPad great isn't the hardware, although it IS spectacular. It's the usability, the software, the apps. The way this thing works, communicates between programs, allows you to just get what you need done without faffing around with 18 clicks (or taps) to do it is what makes it the winner. Sure the HP slate has a camera, usb slot blah blah blah. So what. Ford has sync in their focus but find me someone who would buy that over a BMW and you have yourself a perfect candidate for the competition. Most normal people choose quality and performance in the real world every time in the same way that acceleration from 50mph to 70mph on the highway is much more important than 0-60mph which no one ever does anyway!Buy it, use it, you won't regret it. </content></review>
<review><summary> Don't expect iPad to be an electronic book reader </summary><name> Jeffery A. Lewis </name><date> 2010-04-09 </date><rating> 3 </rating><content> There has been a lot of hype about iPad being a Kindle killer. There are three reasons why the iPad will not make a good book reader. You should be aware of these reasons if you are buying the iPad expecting to read books on it.Reason 1) You will want to read outside and the iPad will not look good outside. Lets face it. Readings a novel is relaxing. Reading outside on a beatiful day is really relaxing. An ebook has to address reading outside. iPad has an LCD screen which will wash out in sunlight. Devices like Kindle and Sony Reader use e-ink technology, a completely different rendering technology, that actually looks better in daylight.Reason 2) iPad is too heavy. The iPad weighs 1.6 pounds. That's about 26 ounces. A Sony Reader and Kindle weigh about 9 to 10 ounces. The iPad weighs almost three times as much. You should be able to hold an ebook with one hand suspended in the air. This will maximize the number of comfortable positions you can achieve with the device. At 1.6 pounds, you will find you cannot hold it up for long with one hand and will have to rest it on something. This severly limits the ergonomic possibilities for the device. You may think this is not important, but you should not overlook how important this is for the reading experience. As matters go, the iPad is not a good device to watch a two hour movie on. Since it is heavy, you will tend to rest it on your lap. That will force you to look down on it. Two hours of doing that, your neck will be sore.Reason 3) Battery life is too short. Ten hours seems like a long time, but for an ebook, it is a hassle to keep it charged to just read, especially when you are on the go. When you toss a small 10 ounce Kindle in your suit case before leaving for a week vacation, you will not have to take the charger, and you will not have to be concerned about plugging it in at the hotel. Devices that use e-ink use power to render the page and to say on standby, but do not use power to leave the page displayed. E-ink devices essentially sip power compared to LCD technology that has to constantly backlight the screen and constantly render the screen. This takes much more power.In iPads defence, iPad could be the better device to read a newspaper. You generally don't read the paper for very long, and you don't read a newspaper linearly like a book. Beautiful layout, color, and multi-touch input could lead to a better newspaper experience. Plus a newspaper is updated daily. An easy way to get daily editions is essential to reading a paper. I think iPad wins out for reading a paper, but not for reading a book. </content></review>
<review><summary> iPad, It is Okay to Return It </summary><name> Angel_Pen </name><date> 2010-04-09 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> A few reasons why the iPad did not work for me other than the excessive price, some of them never mentioned before:1) Extraordinarily fragile device, do not drop it on your carpet, it WILL break.2) Heavier than you think. You won't be able to hold it in your hand for long.3) Can not rest flat on a table or your lap, you will block the WiFi antenna behind the Apple logo and weaken your WiFi signal.4) It isn't really a travel device if it brakes easily and attracts thieves. Is it?5) File transfers are non-existent for most practical uses.6) Someday you will NEED to visit a Flash site and it won't work.7) It will drop to half price in six months.8) If you already have a Netbook, you don't really need an iPad.9) The iPad only runs few truly useful applications, the other 200,000 apps are useless.10) No Photoshop, no memory card reader means useless for photographers.11) The screen resolution for movies really sucks, you need to see it.12) Annoying glossy screen that reflects lights and drives everybody crazy, when are they going to learn that we hate it?13) Applying a screen protector on this large screen without leaving bubbles? Good luck!14) You can't print anything from it. Not even your e-ticket comfirmation. That's just dumb.To be fair, there is one thing the iPad does well: GAMES.Donating $600 to help a child in need is a more fulfilling experience than buying a expensive gadget you do not need. Try it and you will see the difference yourself. </content></review>

When looking at the word iPad what comes to mind? If you said a typo you are correct. When I first heard of this new gadget by Apple, I thought it was a typo and not true. (laughs) So yeah. Iam avoiding this one at all costs. It's way too expensive anyway. I'll stick to my iPod. It's not as heavy(as one reviewer said" and it easily fits in my pocket. Do you want something big that doesn't fit in yourpocket when you're on the go? I didn't think so. I guess this thing was not meant for travel. Maybe for cartraveling but, not for walks and stuff.

<review><summary> Hated it until I bought one </summary><name> John S. Dean </name><date> 2010-04-08 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> Just to set the stage correctly - I'm a multiple Microsoft MVP winner for the tablet PC platform.  I've been using tablets since their inception in the early 2000's and have used Windows since 1988.  I've been programming since 1981.  My level of knowledge is way, way up there.  And until last July, I never even considered a Mac product.  Everything I needed to do was available on Windows, most of the critical apps of mine weren't even available for the Mac OS. Last spring I purchased another car, and I've long had MP3 players, but never an Ipod.  This new car had direct plug access to the Ipods, and allowed all the metadata to display on the radio head unit, as well as full control via the steering wheel controls.  So I got an Ipod, my first Apple device.  For the heck of it I threw the little Apple sticker on my back window and watched everyone who knew me, employees and clients alike (I'm the director of an IT consulting firm), freak out when they saw the apple on my car.Then last July a friend of mine showed me his new Macbook pro, and what got me was the hardware, NOT the software.  The touchpad was just magical, and after trying it, there was no other input method to compare, and all the windows machines had nothing that felt like this glass surfaced beauty.  The backlit keyboard, the solid body (My last two Lenovo's had cracks in their shells just from grabbing one side and picking them up), the design of the hardware was just light years past anything ever done on a PC.  And with the new ones running on the intel processor, and able to directly run windows, not just virtually, it made sense for me to get one.  So I did.Then last November I replaced my 1 year old Media center PC with a new Dell Zino, and a month after that replaced THAT with a new Mac Mini.  So in about 5 months, I went from a Mac hater to someone who had an ipod, a macbook pro, and a Mac Mini.So when the iPad was announced, people weren't sure where I'd fall.  I was a longtime Mac hater, now a convert, but this "first ever tablet device" was hardly that, Microsoft has been doing tablets for a long time.  And my initial take was very, very negative.  Like most of the talking heads out there who didn't like it, I was wondering what possible use something that wasn't a real OS would be, something that can't multitask, and, for my tablet background, why on earth there's no support for pens.  For me, the best thing about tablets and slates has always been notetaking.  I loved MS Journal, and Onenote.  Not for *converting* the handwriting to text, but for persisting my notes IN handwriting.  I liked it.  Worked great.  And the form factor on this device would have been outstanding for such activity. But no joy, we all know how Jobs hates pens.  Don't know why, he thinks it's an "outdated" method of input or some such, yet he puts keyboards on everything, which, according to his type of thinking, should also by now be an outdated type of input...So I had no plans on getting one.  I have been waiting for more info on the HP Slate, which would run Windows 7, have multitasking ability, all the things I was used to on a slate.But I kept thinking about the battery life.  And the form factor.  I use a kindle daily, and this would be a great replacement for it since, while I liked the concept, both versions of the device I've had just still didn't do it for me.  My eyes don't get strained from conventional monitors and displays so it didn't benefit me at all to have the paper ink, but it WOULD benefit me to have a backlit device again for night time reading.  And since the iBook app supposedly would allow me to open other books I already had (I've been doing ebooks for years and years before the kindle was ever announced, reading them on my windows PDA phones and comptuers), there was potential here.But I kept going to the single use, non comptuer OS, limitations.But I also start to twitch when there's a new toy available.  So I started thinking about what I do with computers, both for work and at home, and realized that I didn't *NEED* a full windows 7 slate device with multitasking and everything, since I did not want a second "main" computer.  I keep EVERYTHING for both work and my entire personal life on my laptop, so getting the HP would then necessitate a lot of syncing of data between both the windows side of my macbook as well as the mac side.  Something I don't like dealing with.So I realized I didn't want a full computer.  I didn't need the ipad to replace anything, or take over any existing functionality of my computers.  I wanted it to take over my kindle, and maybe give me some fun drawing apps to play with my 6 year old in.  So I decided to give it a try.So two days ago I ran to the local brick and mortar, figuring they'd be sold out, but at least I could play with a demo unit and see what it was like, get myself past my preconceptions and all the BS flying on the blogosphere.  I picked one up, held it, and two store associates were playing with the one next to me.  I asked them how quickly they sold out - they told me they didn't, that Apple did a great job stocking them, and they had all versions still left.  I decided to not even play with the demo, but just take one home.  So I grabbed the 16GB version (knowing I didn't need it for an ipod and such, so 16GB would be sufficient) and went home.Unboxed quickly since there's nothing but the unit, USB cable, and power adapter.  Came fully charged, so I was up and running instantly.  Within about 15 minutes I had 70 free apps installed already and was moving through things like a pro.  And it dawned on me that even if i wanted that HP Windows 7 based slate, it would NEVER be this smooth.  That is one place where Apple just dominates - the UI.  And this one was great.  Everything worked intuitively, the apps were well designed, and I found my conversions of some of my ebooks to EPUB format installed just fine in Itunes, and showed up just beautifully in iBook.  So the reading experience became way better instantly than the kindle could be.  And with the kindle software available, I can already get the books I purchased there as well, so i had the best of both worlds.  The drawing apps were a big hit for my 6 year old, who, like any kid, loves finger painting.  Weather apps abound, my favorite so far is weatherbug (not a shock, theirs was my favorite gadget for Windows Vista and Windows 7 as well).  I've had storms here, heavy, severe, over the last few days, and my usual thing when dealing with storms at night, while I'm laying in bed reading my kindle, is to randomly get up, go into the great room, and check out the local weather satellites from a few local news stations, see what is still heading this way, how heavy, etc, maybe check mail again while I'm there, then go back and read some more, repeat a few times over an hour or two.  So this time, I just changed form iBook to Weatherbug, saw instantly the local radar, what was still on the way, then hopped into the browser, checked all my mail accounts (the built in Microsoft Exchange support is seamless and works great BTW), and enjoyed the browser, which works and looks just as well as my Safari does on the macbook pro.  So without having to leave my toasty bed, I was reading, checked three weather sites, three mail accounts, and was back reading, all flawlessly, no running around my house.The last part I tried finally last night was instant message, which for me is critical since all my employees use it to keep in touch with me, as do a couple friends.  With the push technology, all the "you can't do this and that at once" fell apart for me and was debunked.  I already had noted that my ipad, regardless of what I was doing or what app I had open, chimed i had a new mail on my works' exchange server before even my smart phone, or my computer directly connected to my exchange server.  And so went my experience with IM as well.  I loaded a client I've used in windows, then closed the IM program and opened iBook, and a buddy of mine sent me a message.  I got not just the notification, but a bubble with his text actually opened in front of ibook, and had a choice of switching over to reply or just close the text bubble and keep reading.  So that really rid me of all concerns about the lack of multitasking since that gives me exactly what I need - notification of an email or an IM while I'm doing something else.  This is all the computing power I needed on this.So I finally realized I didn't WANT another tablet PC, another full fledged computer.  I wanted something to fill a need between my phone's screen and my computer.  Something to replace my kindle, something for some neat games, playing and painting with my 6 year old, and simple/convenient IM and mail access when i'm just vegging at home and don't always want to pull my laptop on my lap to check something quick.The keyboard is actually far easier and better to use than I had expected, and much faster to type on than I hoped.  Not as nice, obviously, as a full screen one, but works surprisingly well.Screen is a delight - even hours of reading later it's still comfortable, bright, but it gets fingerprints easily despite some "non fingerprint coating" they tried to use to minimize it.  Still looks awful after a while at an angle when you look at it askew.  But not at all noticeable while staring at it straight and using it.Screen brightness is good, but it doesn't go down as far as I would've liked for ebook reading, but then I found iBook has a separate brightness control that lets me dim it to nearly nothing for use in the dark.  Outstanding.So then I started throwing some music and photos on it, and that's when I realized I can easily use this to show my grandmother pictures of her great grandson, since she's in her upper 80's and refuses to have a computer, so we can't email her or send her links or anything.  So I started playing with music and photos, and this thing became such a cool toy at that point.  I had to run back to the store and return it so I could buy the larger 32GB model since I knew by this time I was keeping it.  Fortunately I have a 45 day return period with no restocking fees at this place, so the upgrade was painless and free of cost.That's when I found out that itunes was automatically backing up my unit when it synced.  So when I plugged the new one in, the first thing it said was "restore?"  So i tried it.  It restored all my settings, including mail, so all I had to do was reenter passwords the first time, and I was back up and running after it resynced my apps again.  Those stayed in Itunes so I didn't have to redownload everything.Playing with pictures is pretty fun and very smooth, and the speaker on this thing is surprisingly full of bass.  There's even an equalizer for tweaking the sound output to your liking.  And the music keeps playing after you close the app so you can have the tunes playing while doing other things (but it will stop when you hit something else that takes over multimedia like a video or some other sound thing from an email of course).  I grabbed the apple book-like cover and the dock, but you can't charge it in the dock while that cover is on.  So I went from the initial "What a useless piece of junk" detractor to the "I wouldn't live without it" supporter.I gave them all sorts of grief for using the term "magical" to describe it, but I have to say, that it actually felt nearly magical that first hour doing things...   All my experience with the tablet PC and I wasn't ready to experience what this interface was like.  And with this, i may finally be able to get my grandma to have something to keep at her condo so we can email her pictures and such...  This would make it a lot easier for her than trying to get her to use a full computer...So for a first revision, it's a grand slam out of the park hit.  Granted, it's just a big ipod touch or iphone or whatever, but for someone who never used either of those, and wanted something with a useful form factor, this is a BIG hit. </content></review>
<review><summary> Nothing short of extraordinary. </summary><name> Hazel Green </name><date> 2010-04-08 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> Frankly, I had my doubts about this device when it was first announced. Looking at the specifications, this 9.7 inch device running iPhone OS simply begged to be called "a larger iPod Touch".Trying the device for the first time, however, completely changed my mind about this device. It's not the hardware specification that matters, it's the EXPERIENCE.Using the device is an amazing experience. The only word I am going to describe this experience is "LIBERATING". I have a 27in iMac, a 19in custom built PC, and i've owned a unibody MacBook Pro before. In actual usage, none of them allow me to surf the web lying face-up on bed, or lying sideways on a sofa, yet all of them confine my hands to a mouse/trackpad and a keyboard. Whereas the iPad gives me so much freedom. I find myself using it lying on bed, on a sofa, and even standing. When I think back about my previous computing experience, I can't help but to ask myself: "Why should I confine myself to use my own computer in an upright position with my butt glued to a chair and my hands stuck on a table?" In fact, i find myself using this device even more than my beloved 27in iMac simply because it invites me to use it everywhere without boundary. Obviously, you can argue that an smartphone or an iPod Touch can also be used in such a fashion. But allow me to convince you, the display on this device makes all the difference. The display is a 9.7 inch LED backlit IPS display that offers stunning color, and an unbelievable viewing angle. I can literally look at the screen at an angle nearly parallel to the it and still be able to see the amazing image. The screen resolution is also optimal for viewing websites, since most websites are designed for a 1024x768 resolution. This means that no zooming or panning is required when viewing websites on the iPad. The form factor is just right, holding it in hand feels great. It feels extremely sturdy and yet a pleasure to touch. The body of the device is extremely clean and minimalist. The device is extremely fast, scrolling feels very fluid, the entire OS is very responsive. The Multi Touch interface is intuitive and fun to use. The battery life is simply superb, i've used it continuously for more than 10 hours with constant video/music playback and occasional gaming. Obviously this iPad is not going to do programming, encoding videos, or music production. (Some VNC apps do let you control your computer from your iPad) But for my casual computing needs like music/video, web browsing, youtube, facebook and light gaming, this excellent device presents a better experience than traditional laptops. It is a great complementary device to my iMac, with apps like Air Sharing HD and LogMeIn Ignition, i can even access local storage on my iMac from my iPad through local wifi or the internet. Overall, the iPad is a remarkable device, and i am not afraid to say that it gave me the best computing experience i've ever had. </content></review>
<review><summary> I returned the iPad to Apple store today </summary><name> odamae </name><date> 2010-04-08 </date><rating> 1 </rating><content> I jumped on the iPad craze and purchased a 32GB on launch date- I was excited about this device as a way to read books online and to surf the net.  It is a nice looking device and it is very fast.  Unfortunately, I experienced constant dropped WiFi connectivity as I moved throughout the house.  I do not have this problem with other wireless devices and the signal is always strong/excellent.  When the iPad was sitting right next to the router, the internet was much improved but obviously I did not buy a mobile device to be tethered to a stationary router.  I tried all the tricks suggested (rebooting settings, etc) and nothing seemed to help in my situation.  I have a Verizon Actiontec router in the house.Apparently this is not a new issue for Apple wireless devices if you look at the Apple support discussion boards. The iPod also has these issues. Apparently many others are having similar problems with WiFi and iPad.  You would think Apple would work out the bugs before releasing the iPad.I am going to wait a few generations for Apple to get the bugs out.  This is too much money to spend on this kind of "toy" and then to struggle with the internet connection.  I cannot recommend the iPad based on my 5 day experience with it.  This was my very first Apple purchase- too bad Apple wasted this opportunity to lure this PC user to the Apple brand. </content></review>
<review><summary> Switched back to a netbook </summary><name> Rayan Bouajram </name><date> 2010-04-07 </date><rating> 3 </rating><content> I should first note that the iPad has many differences compared to a Netbook, as the average netbook allows consumer to do certain things that an iPad cannot do, and vice versa.  They simply fall into two different categories; both having their own advantages and disadvantages.My personal reasons for using a netbook is simply the portability, low-cost solution to do basic computing and surf the web.  My everyday uses involve taking it to class and typing up notes, and managing my finances.  I typically listen to music and watch videos every now and then.  My netbook can play YouTube videos decently, but it does lag a little when going into full screen.The iPad operates fast and smooth.  Watching videos and using the apps seems to give me that "experience" that I don't necessarily get from a netbook.  Using the familiar iTunes, it's very easy to manage and purchase content for my iPad.  I can tell you that this is a big strength that the iPad has.However, iPad is definitely not a smart solution for my college classes.  I found it harder to type on while in class, making a few mistakes every now and then.  I did get use to the keyboard over time, but it wasn't comfortable compared to the netbook.  Having to look up information and switching back and forth between applications made it an obvious choice that this device is more intended for internet surfing and multimedia.  I feel that the iPad was intended to be a device that is easy to use, so I don't expect multitasking to be available to the device (at all).The iPad's speakers doesn't sound loud, so I recommend using earphones.A feature that I thought would benefit me the most was using the iPad as an eBook reader, too.  The iPad does display content colorful and brilliant, but at 1.5 pounds (compared to 10.2 ounces for a Kindle), this device is quite uncomfortable holding with one hand.  I don't want to drop it either, so two hands it is.For my purposes of reading eBooks and typing up notes in class, this device unfortunately doesn't serve my needs.  For somebody who uses computers for typing emails, surf the web, share photos and videos, and taking advantage of the cool apps, you may find this product more suited for you (just about what the common consumer would use a computer for).  So why did I give this 3 stars?  The device is built sturdy, but it does feel fragile (with no doubt I can easily break these things).  That being said, you do feel obligated to pay a good amount of money for insurance, protection, and accessories.  For 700-800 dollars, I think I'll wait until the prices go down before owning a luxury item like this again. </content></review>
<review><summary> Nice product </summary><name> Christopher Lumsargis </name><date> 2010-04-07 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> I now have been using my iPad for two days. It has gone through a full day workout with my kids (who are enthralled by it) and a full day of work as an itinerant professional in the public schools, using apps that I had purchased for my iPod Touch and using the Netflix app. It has been used as a remote desktop for work; a note taking device; a book reader; a word processing device; and a music player. The only thing it has not yet been used for is games. Movies look impressive on Netflix. As a remote desktop, it runs fairly zippy on a local network, but a tad slow over the Internet. All of my iPod Touch apps run fast, although half of them look somewhat granular in 2X mode. Pages runs really well and opens all of my templates. Someone had commented that it messes up formatting when transferring between files, although this has not been the case with me. Regarding weight, it is lighter than I thought. I can easily whip it out of my carrying case and jot a quick note in the hall. The wifi reception rivals my MacBook. I have yet to drain the battery to check battery life. Overall, it has performed impressively. The only negative thing right now is the fingerprints when the iPad is off. It can look  really dirty and I find myself cleaning it often. </content></review>

<review><summary> IPad Works </summary><name> Robin Wallace </name><date> 2010-04-06 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> Purchased Saturday and it does everything I want it too.  Compared in price to the Kindle with the 6 in screen alone makes this worth it.  Can you say COLOR!  Other than that, why would anyone pay $699.99 for a 16gb iPad from Amazon.com while you could go to the Apple Store and pay $499.00, this has to be a mistake.Also, for you netbook guys, this beats the pants off any netbook I've owned.  It's fast and stable.  Your weak netbook doesn't do anything efficiently. </content></review>
<review><summary> The iPad is amazing, but ill return it </summary><name> Richard Sarno </name><date> 2010-04-05 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> So i went out and bought this brand new Apple iPad on the very fist day. I am very satisfied, but have decided to attempt to return it. Ill explain that.For the stuff it does (apps, ebooks, games, music, pics, videos, etc) it does it all flawlessly and i couldnt possibly complain about any of it. Beyond expectations actually!The problem is it is BIG! I figured i would use it to watch movies or shows on my boring train ride every day. But what do i do with it when im not using it? If i carried a briefcase this wouldnt be an issue, but i dont. I can leave it on my lap, but then i risk either dropping it or being targeted by some thug who wants a new $700 toy for free.The other issue is that its DELICATE! Anyone with an iphone or ipod knows just how delicate these screens are ... and this one is even bigger than those! You can tell its made well, but a single drop will break the screen guaranteed.So while i do think its an amazing device, i think i can easily live without it. Maybe it would have been an easier decision to keep it if it hadn't cost me $700 ($499 + tax + replacement insurance which you MUST have!!)That's all. Good luck with yours, enjoy.PS, im not happy about spending $700 on something and it doesn't even come with a case or protective screen?? Common apple seriously!!! And then they boast the HD screen for movies ... but the movies cost $20 EACH!! They boast the ebook reader, but the good illustrated books are expensive!!

<review><summary> Fast, Gorgeous, but Heavy </summary><name> Daniel G. Lebryk </name><date> 2010-04-04 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> From the first announcement of this device, I was prepared to dislike the iPad, on paper it has way too many flaws. With one in hand and actually using the device, I can honestly say it is an excellent, gorgeous, piece of hardware. The biggest flaw, it weighs a ton. The weight doesn't sound like a bad thing, but after I held this device in both hands while laying down, my arms got sore. It's a small thing, but you should be aware that it is heavy.Set up was super simple. Connect the unit to your computer, run iTunes, follow the wizard. About 5 minutes later the iPad is set up and activated. The wizard does call it an iPhone for some strange reason. If you have an iPhone already, the set up is a bit easier. It will inherit most of your settings.Once activated, you have to unplug the unit and then go through the settings application to set up your wireless network and a variety of other settings. All pretty obvious, top to bottom, essentially all the same as the iPhone. Do note that the charger is a 10W charger - much larger and different from the iPhone's 5W charger. So you'll have to use that charger. There is a big negative, you'll have to cart around that charger, most USB ports will not charge this device. My beast of a PC has plently of power on all the USB ports, and it will not charge my iPad. External battery packs will work with no trouble charging, or extending the use.Battery life - I ran video, downloaded a ton of apps, and played with this thing for a solid 2 hours - 10% of the battery life was used. I would guess that reported battery life is right accurate. Typing is easier than on an iPhone, but still not keyboard easy. There's a big problem with how to hold the device and type at the same time. I was a master at Blackberry typing with my thumbs. I can't seem to get it with the iPad. The other problem, the device has a rounded back, so if you place it on a table and try to type, the thing rocks back and forth annoyingly. I don't think I will spend a lot of time typing long emails on this device.  Apps that are built for or converted to the iPad format are simply gorgeous. They are full of detail and easy to read. Old iPhone apps that have not been upgraded are all blocky and not so great (useable but not great). You have the option to click the app back to native size if the jaggies bother you.Safari works really well on this device. The browser is a real live browser that displays WebPages beautifully. Bookmarks snap up in an instant. Pages load at almost lightning speed, actually faster than on my desktop computer (quad core 3GHz, gigabit wired connection). There is almost no need to have multiple pages open, since load times are so fast and the favorites menu is so easy to access. There is just no comparison to the iPhone's horrible display of WebPages.  Email takes on a whole new look. Embedded pictures display beautifully. There is a pop up ribbon to select email from your inbox. Navigation is just a pleasure. Account switching is a little different from the iPhone, but still very intuitive. Apple seems to have figured out how to make the email experience more intuitive and remove the unnecessary from view. Video is stunning. Netflix over high speed WiFi (my connection is 22Mbps) delivers full screen, highly detailed, smooth video with good sound. Any video created for the iPhone plays, but they are significantly pixilated or blocky, basically you've blown up a video designed for a three inch screen to three times that size. Those videos are viewable, but I will be reconverting my source video to the larger size. Some of the free apps I've tried. ABC is simple and stunning for watching video, but lacks a lot of programs. Craigslist adds the ability to view pictures in the preview of a listing, something not available on any other computer - very handy feature. USA Today has done an awful job, the interface is horribly confusing and pretty well useless. Weatherbug is incredible, simple and to the point, but with a ton of forecast information (including webcams for different weatherbug stations). NASA is silly, an enlarged version of their iPhone app. Pandora works perfectly as expected. The iPod / music side plays like I expected. Nothing really new there. The oddity though, iPod / music is on the home base menu, but video is a separate application. Everyone would expect that Apple got the music player right. I've had an iPhone 3G for almost two years and have disliked almost every minute of use. I got it for work email and it sort of delivers on that promise. The iPad is what the iPhone should have been all along - fast, simple to use, and a gorgeous screen. I also own a netbook. The iPad is a much better device. I love this device. Is it a revolution in computing? Only time will tell. For the moment, this is the best video, audio, email, web browsing device I've ever seen. Go try it at a store. I think you will fall in love.April 11 Update - Kindle versus iPad - I own them both. The Kindle is the better e-reader by a long long margin for avid readers. e-Ink is easy on the eyes, it looks just like a book. Where ever you can read a book, you can read a Kindle. The Kindle is light weight, about on par with a real book, maybe a bit lighter. And the plastic has a really fine satin feel. After about ten minutes reading on a Kindle, I don't think of the device anymore. The iPad - pages look gorgeous. Winnie the Pooh is absolutely stunning, with the color images, the perfect page layout, sharp beautiful type, fun page turning animation, and a kind of 3D look that mimics a book. But, it weighs a lot more than a book, more like a big old heavy text book. The hand feel - aluminum and glass - not as wonderful as the Kindle. I keep thinking, this is such a cool device that I don't lose myself in the reading. Buying books with the Kindle is a super snap, under a minute and I've got my book. Buying them with the iPad? Sorry I'll never buy a book through iTunes, just like I've never bought a song at iTunes. Amazon has the review world covered and they know how to sell books. But, and here's the big but, the majority of the public is going to love the iPad reader software. They will marvel at the color pages and love the book buying experience, just like they love buying music through iTunes. It will be a success. The avid reader will stick with paper or a Kindle, or a Sony reader, or a Nook. There just is no substitute for e-Ink. And, yes my eyes hurt reading the iPad screen; and no you can't read a book easily in the sun (especially not the beach). And if you think I'm silly saying the device is heavy - there's three pretty savvy tech people that agree, Patrick Norton (a big strong guy) and Veronica Belmont of Tekzilla (an intense WOW gamer, so she has strong hands), and Molly Wood of CNet. Molly has returned her iPad because it is too heavy among other reasons. </content></review>
<review><summary> A leap in the right direction </summary><name> Craig Whisenhunt </name><date> 2010-04-04 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> I've now spent the better part of a day playing with the new iPad, and while it excels in many things there are still some things anyone considering buying one should probably keep in mind.First the good sides:This thing is very fast, opening and closing applications is quick, the screen is incredibly responsive, there is no lag while typing, and the built in Safari browser does a great job of quickly loading even graphic intense pages.The not so good sides:As has been thoroughly pointed out, there is not presently much in the way of multitasking within the iPhone OS, but with most expectations pointing towards a summer release of OS 4.0 this might be remedied by mid summer, and almost certainly by a generation 2 release.  That said, it should be kept in mind that on such a little screen being able to view multiple applications at once will likely never be something you'll use, and the speed by which you can open and close applications makes this less a headache than you might think.  It isn't as fast as moving between open apps, but it isn't a deal breaker by any means.  The lack of a camera in this generation is a little surprising, while I've purchased my iPad already, I honestly believe that with the number of competitors expected over the course of 2010 we're probably going to see a generation 2 by Christmas with a camera.  It's still an amazing device, but the ability to video chat with it would definitely put it over the top, that's a feature worth waiting for.  The lack of Flash support isn't as irritating as I expected it to be, but still something to consider.  Many major sites have evolved to html5, or are in the process of doing so.  This allows for full viewing by the Safari browser, and where it exists, it works great.  The remaining sites still using Flash show up with annoying little boxes looking for a plugin that is likely never going to exist.  If you spend a lot of time on flash heavy sites it really probably is worth considering holding out to see how the Slate/Android Tablets look in a few months, but if you're mostly just e-mailing and checking facebook (no Farmville) the lack of Flash support probably won't bother you too much.As a laptop replacement:The inclusion of the iWorks utilities gives this device a little bit of a laptop personality.  Don't let that persuade you into believing that you don't need a computer though.  You might be able to get away with ditching a laptop if all you really do is e-mail or very light word processing, but if you do anything more than that you'll like the freedom and ease a full computer offers for more complex tasks.  That said, this device is a tremendous leap towards a future tablet style device that may very well be a replacement for your computer, but for now it is more of a casual use device than something you can really expect to do substantial work with.  I have put together a presentation in keynote, which was easy enough to do, but pages isn't as intuitive as I'd have liked, and taking lengthy notes or writing long letters/e-mails/reports will probably make it worth considering buying either the keyboard dock or the wireless bluetooth keyboard.Battery life seems to live up to the claims, I managed to get about 7 hours before getting the 20% remaining battery life indication, which puts it about right for 10 hours or so of total use.  One very important thing to realize about charging the device is that presently (at launch) there is some issues with charging via USB from many computers.  The iPad is different than other iPod products, it requires a bit more power to charge up, and unfortunately most USB ports aren't set up to support that higher power draw.  This is something that may be fixed in a firmware update to allow for a slower charge, or it may simply be that you'll need to either rely on a new Mac (seems like they can handle the power issue) or rely on the wall charger.  Just don't be surprised if you plug it into your computer and it doesn't show that it is charging.All in all, the iPad is an impressive device that might make for a reasonable replacement of a netbook for casual users.  For people who need something to really do a lot of work on, you may find that for the price that a netbook or laptop still offers the better value for your needs.  Future generations of this device will probably transition into fitting that market better than this first generation.  However, if you're an avid reader, casual gamer, music fan, who doesn't do much more on the web than check a few sites, and e-mail.  This thing is definitely worth considering!  If you're on the fence, nothing about this product is so incredible as to justify running out and buying one right now, but it is worthy of your consideration if you're thinking you might like a tablet style device.  I definitely would encourage you to go play with one at best buy or an apple store to get a feel for it.  With a number of competitors due out over the next few months we're likely to see some price movement, or a second generation release, so it may be worth it to wait it out a little while.One final note, the screen is absolutely gorgeous while it is turned on.  It is crisp, bright, and very easy to see from any angle.  But when you turn it off, every finger print and swipe is suddenly very visible (while it is on the light is bright enough you don't see them fingerprints).  If you are a neat freak, or just hate finger prints on your devices you'll have to invest in some microfiber cloths or get used to using your shirt sleeve!In conclusion, it's a lot of fun, and I'm not the least bit sorry to have bought one.  It does many things, and over the next months will do many more.  If you think you want one, go play with one, and if you don't want to wait for a next generation this one is definitely awesome.  If you have specific needs that aren't really addressed in this generation or by apple, don't let the hype or peer pressure bully you into this one, there are a number of devices coming with great potential, one of those might be a better fit. </content></review>
<review><summary> People Who Actually Use iPads Tend to Like Them - A Lot </summary><name> Glenn R. Howes </name><date> 2010-04-04 </date><rating> 5 </rating><content> I've had an iPad since the first day they were available. It's taken it's place in the household as the preferred way to browse the web, watch bedtime videos with the kids, and play games. Just yesterday, my four year old son sat around the device with his friend playing Plants vs. Zombies HD and it was as easy, natural and comfortable as if they were playing tic tac toe instead of an elaborate tower defense game. It would not have been possible for two four year olds to share a game like that with the mechanics of mousing in the way on a desktop computer or on the cramped screen of an iPhone. [Update: iPad Camera Connection Kit: I received my iPad Camera Connection Kit recently and that works well, quickly and slickly. It comes as two parts: an SD reader module and a USB port module. The idea being that you can either take the SD card out of your camera or you can connect the camera directly depending on the module. Pop it together and photos and movies are imported into the Camera Roll, and are viewable if the iPad can handle the format, so JPEG images off the SD card from my Lumix can be displayed, as can RAW images imported over USB from my Nikon D-3000. All RAW formats are not viewable, but they should be transferable. I was not able to use a 3rd party SD reader with the USB port as it "used too much power." The USB connector also allows a 3rd party audio device, so you can get digital optical stereo (not surround) out of your iPad instead of the normal dock connectors analog line out. Mass storage devices are apparently not supported.]In my opinion, the iPad delivers an unmatched content delivery capability. The browsing experience alone is worth the price of admission, but it does so many other activities so well and with such beauty and an organic interaction between user and content that just scratches the surface of what can be done.This is not a general purpose computer. I am not going to write much source code on it or transcode video or those other activities my laptop and desktop computers do so well. And while text entry is markedly better than on an iPhone, I would not look forward to writing anything longer than this review on its keyboard, although with each sentence of experience I achieve that gets less true. No, what this is is a viewing computer without peer. You have not browsed the web until you do it with the firm swipes of mobile Safari. I know people have fixated on the lack of Flash and Flash advertising, games and video. And maybe for some people that is a big loss. For me, the only loss is the occasional home improvement show on Hulu, and it seems likely there will be an app for that just as there are ones for Netflix, ABC, Youtube, etc, while sites like CBS put some, but not all,  content into DRM free HTML 5 video. What you lose in Flash you more then make up for in the amazing speed of browsing and how natural it all seems.  (Having said this, the first time I asked my wife to try answering her e-mail on the device, the first message was to a Flash greeting card.)The speed of the device is amazing for a low power portable device. Maybe it's the Apple custom A4 processor, or maybe it's the limitation of having so few processes, or the optimization of the OS for GPU acceleration, but the iPad is liquid fast at nearly everything. Video playback is fast. Photo browsing is fast. Mail is fast. The calendar is fast. Large games like Plants Versus Zombies HD launch in a fraction of the time they do on an iPhone. You get the idea.Third party developers have stepped up to the plate and delivered both beauty and added functionality. The Kindle app is smooth and imported all my Kindle account books quickly--it's good that there will be competition in the iPad eBook market between Apple's own iBooks store and Amazon't Kindle. The Weather HD app is stunning as it embroiders the mundane delivery of a weather report. Wolfram Alpha is big and well laid out and more powerful than ever. As for the hardware, I am really liking this screen. It is bright, colorful and sharp with an amazing viewing angle. It does get a little smudged which is noticeable when watching movies but its oleo-phobic screen cleans with a quick wipe.. Its wide viewing angle is a great improvement on my MacBook's screen which would be unreadably dark at the angle I'm typing this. Some people think the iPad is surprisingly heavy, while someone else was surprised how light it was (the same person also expressed remorse at having bought a Nook after about 8 seconds of playing with my iPad).Be careful with charging this. It likely won't work with your current iPhone  car charger. My wife's car charger started to burn trying to handle the extra amperage this device demands. Best to only use this with either your computer's USB ports or the charger it came with. And charging time is slow via a computer, from full empty it takes 7 minutes until reboot, and around 40 minutes per 10% charge (so you are looking at over 6 hours for a full charge from fully drained). The wall adapter is about twice as fast. Regardless, be prepared to make over night charging part of your daily routine, although you will get several days of moderate use between charges given the amazing 10+ hours of activity you get from a full charge. A decade of laptop use has not prepared me for how long you can use this to do everything. It seemingly doesn't matter what you are doing, you still get 10 hours. Or more.   It goes without saying that you do not want to charge this device from your laptop's battery like you might do to your iPhone on a lengthy plane trip.As for the decision to buy the 64 GB model, I think it comes down to perceived usage. I plan to fill it with quality feature length movies for when my wife travels to China. At about 1.5GB per movie (720x480 h.264)--or more if you have 720p content--16GB seemed a little tight while still loading multiple gigabytes of photos and music. 32 GB would probably be sufficient, and it's going to seem insane in a couple years spending so much for 32 GB of flash memory.If you get a chance to play with one, try to find a comfy chair where you can put your feet up and make a platform for the device. This will negate the problem of holding its heft and allow you to build up your full speed typing skills. Realize there are all sorts of tricks you will learn and that after an hour you will be a master. Lock the iPad into landscape mode using the hardware toggle switch. I find I never have a need to use portrait mode unless a piece of software makes use of a separate portrait mode. Explore. There are so many little delightful touches to discover like the lock screen photo frame mode, the dictionary in the book reader, tapping on the status bar to go to the top of a web page, etc.This is a moving target. Every time Apple releases a new version of the OS or a 3rd party developer gets a bright idea, the device will get better. For instance, Apple has announced iPhone OS 4 which addresses many major complaints people have and adds features we didn't know we needed. This fall, you will be able to keep Pandora and Skype running the background while you are playing a game or browsing the web or whatever; this will make these apps vastly more useable. You will be able to organize your apps in folders. Better organize your e-mail. And look forward to smaller developers coming out with more social network games.If I were to point out one misfeature it is how badly the 2x mode for legacy iPhone apps looks. It just seems as though Apple could have put more effort in making non-bitmap GUI elements look sharp instead of just stretching all the pixels. You would think they could at least have made text and the built in keyboard look better.I don't like the Apple branded optional case, so I would try before buying the case. It just gets in the way making it hard to access the external controls, and should only be necessary in a scratch prone environment. I am thinking about going with a Gelaskin protective skin instead.In summary, I am a big fan of this device for a wide variety of activities be it web browsing, game playing, enjoying media, reading email (less so composing email), and reading books. I highly recommend picking one up if you have the means, although I would wait a few weeks until they are back in stock at the normal retail prices or even until the 3G version comes out. </content></review>

<review><summary> Answer: my 76 year old mom </summary><name> A. Wang </name><date> 2010-03-24 </date><rating> 4 </rating><content> Why would anyone want one? I would love for my mom to be tech savvy, to be able to wipe and reinstall her system software, to backup her hard drive on a regular basis, to upgrade and install RAM into the motherboard of her computer, to run the terminal to ping IPs to see why she can't get through somewhere. Is it going to happen? No. I'm not being pessimistic; she really has better things in her life to do. She's 76! I can't even adequately explain the concept of windows and menubars in a way that makes sense to her. Not to mention she has tremors and has a difficult time holding and accurately directing a mouse. I could get her an iPod Touch. I love mine, by the way. But with her near-sightedness and hand shaking, good luck touching the correct tiny little icon.With all that said, mom is getting a nice iPad w/ 3G for her birthday. I may not need one -- though they are awfully pretty and would be a wonderful lightweight companion while traveling -- but I really think my mom does. Besides, she loves games and this is a great way for her to keep her mind active while also being able to check her stocks, her email and whatever else she wants to do.And me? I will have saved countless hours of PC support time. Time that I can use enjoying time with my elderly mom rather than beating my head against a wall. </content></review>
